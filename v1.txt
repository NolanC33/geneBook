EXPLANATION. 

Two Indexes have been prepared for descendants of each of the 
four progenitors. One giving the Christian names of Cranes, the other, 
names of persons who have intermarried with them ; alphabetically 
arranged. 

Also an index of Christian names of Cranes found in the Addenda. 
In looking for a certain name, unless you know to which line the 
person belongs it will be necessary to examine each of the Ave indexes. 

The number after the name is the consecutive number. Turn to this 
number in the body of the book and you will find the person's family 
record. If the person had no family the number will refer to the birth 
under the parent's name. If the Index does not give the name sought, 
And n;ime of the parent, and look through the list of the children. 
Some names came too late for numbering. Where there are several 
names alike, the year of birth placed before the name may help to 
indicate the one sought. 

The bracketed [ — ] number after the name of a parent refers to the number where the person appears as a child. After the name of a  parent the pedigree is indicated in parentheses ( ) with small figures above, showing to what generation the name helongs, and giving the 
names back as far as the progenitor of the line. 

The following abbreviations have been used: b. for born, m. for 
married, unm. for unmarried, (s. settled), d. for died.

PREFACE 



VOLUME I. of the Crane Family Genealogy, published in 1895, 
contains an article on Origin of the name Crane; copies of 
five different armorials belonging to the family ; a sketch of the 
Crane family in England, with pedigrees covering thirteen genera- 
tions, and a brief reference to the first of the name who came to 
New England, together with Henry Crane of Wethersfield and 
Guilford. Conn., and his descendants of nine generations; a list 
of Cranes who served in Connecticut as lawmakers and public 
officials ; also a list of members of the family who served in the 
French and Indian, as well as the Revolutionary war, from 
that State. There has been considerable delay in issuing the 
second volume, and no doubt some interested persons have 
become impatient to see the work in print. But the task 
of tracing the lines from live different progenitors has been 
no easy one. Special care has been exercised in keeping each 
line of descendants independent of the other, although they 
have in some instances intermarried, and in many cases resided 
for years in close proximity to each other. Volume II. has 
exceeded in size our most sanguine expectations, for the 
reason that the descendants of Jasper and Stephen Crane of 
New Jersey have so willingly assisted in supplying records 
from private sources that could in no other way be furnished. 
The early public records of New Jersey, so far as the writer's 
experience extends, furnish a very unsatisfactory field for the 
genealogist. During the early settlements there seems to have 
been no fixed system for recording births, marriages and deaths 
for preservation. Probate Records have supplied the greater 
portion of the early records for the descendants of Jasper and 
Stephen Crane. Some of the early church records, from which 
much was expected, were found to have been destroyed by fire. 
The lack of dates has caused a vast amount of trouble in estab- 
lishing the identity of certain members of the family. "Where 



there seemed any doubt of the identification it has been ex- 
pressed in the context or by a foot-note. 

Although the writer has given a vast amount of time, and a 
considerable sum from his means in prosecuting this work, still 
he is fully aware how difficult is the task of collecting material 
and compiling a work of this nature, and presenting it free from 
inaccuracies. Every effort has been made to avoid errors, and 
wherever different dates or conflicting statements have been 
received regarding the same event, which has frequently been 
the case, careful investigation has followed in order to determine 
if possible the correct statement to be used in the book. To 
the many friends who have in any way contributed to the 
encouragement of this work the writer would here express his 
profound gratitude. Among the names of those who have 
given special aid in its prosecution may be mentioned : Rev. 
Elias Nettleton Crane. Rev. Oliver Crane and James Eells 
Crane, all deceased; the latter died Nov. 19, 1893, in Phila- 
delphia, Pa. ; William M. Crane, Greenville, Mich. ; Stephen S. 
Crane, Maple Hill Farm, High Ridge, Conn. ; Harrison Horton 
Crane, Middletown. N. Y. ; Augustus S. Crane, Elizabeth, N. J. ; 
Miss A. J. Reed, Carmel, N. Y. ; Dorothy N. Law, Dixon, 111. ; 
Anna Russell Vance, Milwaukee, Wis. ; Henry Harmon Noble, 
Albany, N. Y. ; Horatio Grain, Key West, Fla. : and J. M. 
Crane, Kingwood, West Va. 

Records of several families needing further proof to define 
their position in the body of the book have been placed in the 
Addenda with the hope that some of the descendants may be 
able to find the connecting link. In some instances the peculiar 
spelling of names has been retained, believing members of the 
families would prefer to have them presented in that way.

BENJAMIN CRANE. 



Windsor was probably the first town settled in Connecticut by 
the English, and Wethersfield next. The former made its 
beginuing in the year 1633 and the latter in 1634. The people 
who planted these towns were almost without exception from 
Massachusetts. In the year 1621 and for many years thereafter 
practically all settlers bound for New England lauded in the 
colony of New Plymouth or Massachusetts, and emigrated from 
there to the various settlements of their choice. For several 
years Windsor, Wethersfield and Hartford proved the chief 
attractions for settlers locating west of the Connecticut River, 
although a few planted themselves at Saybrook. Many of those 
who early settled at Wethersfield came from Watertown, Mass., 
while the towns of Cambridge and Dorchester furnished a con- 
siderable number of the families for Windsor, and Newtown 
furnished some for Hartford. The emigrants from Dorchester, 
Mass., named their town Dorchester, now Windsor. Wethersfield 
was called Watertown, and Hartford was called Newtown. But 
at the meeting of the General Court of the Connecticut colony 
in 1637 the present name was decided upon and adopted. This, 
however, was not the first session of the General Court of 
this colony Their first session was held April 26, 1636. 

Rev. Henry Smith was the first settled minister in Wethersfield ; 
came there about the year 1636, but was not installed until the 
year 1640 or 1644. and died 1648. 

The early records of Wethersfield are exceedingly interesting 
and voluminous, yet lack system and completeness. The records 
of births, with some deaths, are furnished from 1635 to about 
1666 ; and after an interval of some years the record of deaths 
is again taken up with the year 1670, and the births and mar- 
riages about the year 1692. Subsequent to the year 1700 there 
seems to have been a more complete system of entries through- 
out all the departments. On the whole, however, the records at 
W T ethersfield are perhaps in as good condition in all respects and 



10 CRANE GENEALOGY. 

are as well preserved as the average of the early New England 
towns. The entries of dates of births of children of Benjamin 
Crane senior were apparently made eight years subsequent to the 
last birth, and records of lands assigned to or owned by Benja- 
min Crane, senior, in one or two instances, were also apparently 
entered some years after possession had been given ; a fact 
which, to say the least, shows a slack method of making import- 
ant records during the early life of the town. But the des- 
cendants of this progenitor may congratulate themselves that so 
much has been recorded and preserved to be used by them in 
rearing their genealogical tree. 



FIRST GENERATION. 



1. Benjamin Crane, was in Wethersfleld, Conn., as early as 
1655, and may have been there a few years earlier. According 
to the Records of the Particular Court, held at Hartford, March, 
1655, he is defendant in a civil suit with John Sadler, pltf. ; also 
in June, 1656, he is defendant in another suit with Richard 
Montague. He was born about 1630; was made freeman May 
12, 1658, at Wethersfleld. It is not positively known from 
whence he came to Wethersfleld, 'but Hinman in his " History of 
Connecticut Settlers " seems to think that he came from Massachu- 
setts, which statement all investigations thus far seem to warrant. 
February 24, 1656, the town gave him a home lot of 2 1 - acres, 
more or less, bounded by the Common N. W., a brook and the 
home lot of John Graves N. E., the Common S. E., the high- 
way S. W. He also bought John Dixon's or Dickenson's land in 
the West Field, Sept. 14, 1664. The latter is said to have 
removed to Hadley 1659 or 1660. It appears that this last men- 
tioned tract of land was that on which the late home of Sam'l 
Coleman, deceased, stands, on Mud Lane. It was there when Mr. 
Crane built his dwelling-house and tanneries. The house was one 
of the six houses fortified by vote of the town in 1704. The town 
also gave him three acres of land on Beaver, now Tando's, 
Brook, in 1660; served as juror 1664 : drew land in the allot- 
ment of 1670, and purchased land of Daniel Rose, Dec. 8, 1671. 
Jauuary 15, 1673, he is rated among inhabitants of Wethersfleld 
to pav the town 0-4-5£; acquires more land next south of Job 
Whiteomb's, February 22, 1680, March 25, 1680, July 13, 1680; 
under latter date the land is located on the Connecticut River 
on road to Middletown and road to Rocky Hill. 

May, 1682, Benjamin Crane with others petitioned the Gen- 
eral Court for liberty to " erect a plantation in the Wabaynassit 
country" (Windham County). It was proposed to have a 
'• Town Grant " ten miles square. 

He married Mary Backus, daughter of William and Sarah 
(Charles) Backus, April 23, 1655, and carried on the tanning 
business about a mile below the village on the Middletown road. 
The spot for many years has been known as "Old Crane's 
Tannery Place." At his death. May 31, 1691, his son John 
succeeded to the business. She died July 8, 1717. Children: 

2—1. Benjamin, born March 1, 1656; drowned June 20, U!93.

FIRST GENERATION. l-> 

July 10, 1710. Whereas Benjamin Crane senior had a piece of 
land granted by the town near Rocky Hill, the court gave half to 
John and half to Jacob. Now John was dead, and Jacob 
agreed with John Chester for the estate of John Crane, and 
James Steel guardian for Josiah, son of John, to divide it, 
Josiah to have the north half and Jacob (his uncle) to have the 
south part. 

June 11. 1711. Mary Crane of Wethersfield, for the love she 
bore for her grandson, Benonie Crane, son of Abraham, gave 
him 1 H acres, being on or near a place in Wethersfield known as 
or called Cow Plain, being one-half of that lot laid out to said 
widow Crane free and clear. 

June 13, 1713. An agreement between the heirs of Benjamin 
Crane senior and Benjamin. Jr. Jonathan Crane owned three 
and one-half acres, for which he was to receive £20 current. 
The heirs of Abraham Crane paid the £20. and Jonathan Crane 
signed a release to all claims to the estate. 

In the year 1693 we find the number of acres land held by the 
family in Wethersfield. as follows : Jacob Crane, 51 acres 10-i 
rods; John Crane. 102 acres 15^ rods; Widow Mary Crane, 106 
acres 23 rods; Israel Crane, 109 acres 13 rods; Abraham Crane, 
116 acres 9^ rods ; Joseph Crane, 163 acres 24 rods. 



SECOND GENERATION. 



11. Benjamin Crane' 3 [2], Benjamin' was chosen Rate Maker 
in 1685. Married 1st Mary Chapman, May 12. 1(386, Capt. 
Benjamin Newbury performing the ceremony. She died April 5. 
1687, aged 22 years. He then married Martha Boardman, horn 
August 12, 1666. He was drowned June 20, 169:3, in his 38th 
year. His widow married Samuel Terry of Enfield, June 5, 
1697-8, Capt. John Chester performing the ceremony. She died 
May 29, 1743, in her 77th year, having had five sons and a 
daughter by her last marriage. 

Martha, his widow, exhibited Inventory of estate of Benj. 
Crane, Jr., January 13, 1693; was appointed administratrix 
1693. November 5, 1693, his estate inventoried 55 — 13 — 10. 

The widow drew land at the allotment in Wethersfield 1694. 
She was again after her marriage appointed administratrix 
April 19, 1698. Children: 

12—1. Benjamin, born Nov. 7, 1600; .1. Mav, 1093. 

13-2. Isaac, born Aug. 19, 1692. d. Sept. Hi, 1712, and left his will, 
dated Sept. 15, 1712; mentions his four brothers by his 
mother, Widow Martha, who married Samuel Terry, quite 
likely children by Mr. Terry. After his debts are paid he 
wills that his four brothers by his mother have all his 
estate and to be equally divided, but if any of them are 
sickly or weakly they should have more than the rest, and 
further said that he counted that they were the uearest 
relatives that he had. He appeared before the court and 
made choice of Lt. Jonathan Borman or Boardman as his 
guardian. This Jonathan was brother of his mother 
Martha, and born February 4, 1660, at Wethersfield. Lt. 
Jonathan accepted the charge, and gave bond May 1, 1710. 
May 2, 1711, he asked the court to require Samuel Terry of 
Enfield and Martha, his wife, administratrix on estate 
late Benjamin Crane, Jr., to render an account of said 
estate. October 6, 1712, court issued the order to report 
before first Monday of June next. March 2, 1712-13, they 
exhibited the account. Nearly the whole estate had been 
expended on Isaac, the only child of said Benjamin. May 
4, 1713, Samuel and Martha were discharged. 

The life of Benjamin Crane [2], although brief, was rather an 
eventful one. 

April 3, 1685, he purchased land of John Ryley, and his 
brother John Crane was witness to the transaction. 

April 14, 1686, he took a deed from Nathaniel Foot of land 
situated iu Wethersfield on the Connecticut River. 



SECOND GENERATION". 



April 14, 1690, Daniel Sayre and his wife Sarah of Southamp- 
ton, N. Y., deeded to Benjamin Crane, Jr., " Tanner," land in 
Wethersfield. 

January 3, 1692, he took a deed of land situated in "South 
field," Wethersfield, of Thomas Hosmer of Northampton, Mass. 

July 2, 1692, Benjamin Crane, Jr., son and heir of Benjamin, 
late of Wethersfield, deceased, quitclaimed land to his brother 
Joseph Crane dated "April 19, in y e 4th year of y' reign of our 
sovereign Lord and Lady, William and Mary" (1692). This 
document was witnessed by his brother John Crane, and to which 
both signed their full names. The reader will notice that 
Benjamin, Jr., was also a tanner; in fact the family seemed to 
adopt that occupation in connection with the tilling of the soil, 
Benjamin. Sr., with his brother Henry. Benjamin, Jr.. and 
brother John, all being tanners, and there may have been others 
of the family who followed that line of business. According to 
accessible records Benjamin, Jr., seems to have deferred his 
marriage rather beyond the average for his time. Early mar- 
riages were the custom as well as rule in those days, and to defer 
such an important event until the age of thirty must have required 
no small degree of independence, fortified with a record of good 
moral character, for Mr. Royal R. Hinman, the historian, tells us 
that the general court of the Connecticut colony ordered that no 
young unmarried man, unless a public officer, or he keep a 
servant, should keep house alone, except by license of the town, 
under a penaltv of twenty shillings per week ; and that no head 
of a family should entertain such young man under a like penalty 
without liberty from the town. 

Benjamin Crane, Jr., was enjoying the confidence of his fellow 
townsmen when Sir Edmund Andros appeared as the willing tool 
of King James II. in the capacity of Governor of New England, 
and whose subsequent actions, including the demand for the 
surrender of the charter of Connecticut, were so distasteful to 
the people that more or less criticism was expressed, sometimes 
it being uot altogether complimentary to the Governor and his 
associates, and it came to the ears of the officials about Hartford 
that Benjamin Crane had used language reflecting upon then- 
good name and character. 

Those familiar with our colonial history will remember that Sir 
Edmund Andros, who had been governor of New York, arrived 
in Boston. December 20, 1686* with a commission from King- 
James II. for the government of New England, apparently the 
object being to bring all the various colonies under one govern- 
ment, he to" be governor-in-chief, with the seat of government at 
Boston. 

December 22 Andros wrote Governor Robert Treat that he was 
ready to receive the surrender of the charter of Connecticut and

assume control of all New England. Governor Treat replied 
that his people were loyal people of his majesty, and wished to 
continue as such, and should submit to his majesty's royal com- 
mands, even if it be to conjoin his colony with the other colonies 
and provinces. A very courteous letter, but rather non-com- 
mittal. June 13, 1687, Andros again wrote, pressing his demand 
a little harder. 

October 2"2, 1687, he wrote, demanding annexation. October 
31 he appeared in Hartford at the head of a troop of soldiers, 
and formally took possession of the colony, appointed Governor- 
Robert Treat and Capt. John Allen members of his council, and 
renewed his demand for the charter ; but during the debate in 
the General Court, then assembled in Hartford in the evening, 
suddenly the lights were extinguished and the charter was carried 
and concealed in a hollow tree standing on the Willys estate; 
and this tree was subsequently known as the " Charter Oak." 

The people were not willing to give up their charter, upon 
which all their property rights and privileges as citizens were 
based. They were not pleased with the proposed changes in the 
new form of government. They were willing to let well enough 
alone. Dissensions coutinued, not alone in Connecticut, but in 
Massachusetts as well ; and after Andros had made his tour on 
through to New York and return, he reached Boston in October, 
1688, to find that public sentiment had become aroused against 
him ; the revolution came, and he was deposed and imprisoned. 
Escaping from jail he fled to Rhode Island, was there re-arrested, 
taken back to Massachusetts, and sent to England, and from 
there he went to Virginia, where he was made governor, but 
died in London, February 2-i, 1714. With the downfall of 
Andros, Where did the power of government rest? was the ques- 
tion that occupied the minds of the people. Should the old 
officers who were in power when Andros took possession be rein- 
stated, or new ones elected, and who had authority to call an 
election? These were perplexing questions ; good people differed 
as to the proper course to follow. In Hartford there was a sort 
of public gathering, at which excitement ran high ; votes were 
taken and doubts expressed as to the result, but at last the vote 
to reinstate old officers was declared carried, although many per- 
sons doubted the correctness of that decision. Governor Treat, 
however, in October, 1690, when challenged as to his jurisdiction 
in a trial before the court of assistants, claimed the election to 
have been legal. 

Now it seems that Benjamin Crane, Jr., was among those who 
opposed Andros, and his assistants, and therefore belonged to 
the party for retaining the old charter. Andros was no stranger 
to the people of Connecticut. For many years while governor 
of New York he had been harassing this colony with his unrea- 
sonable demands, even going to the extent of appearing off 
Saybrook. July 8, 167.3. with two vessels filled with armed men

to press a lauding for the purpose of taking possession of what 
was then one of the chief ports of that colony, thus attempting 
to rob the Connecticut people of valuable territory, of which 
they had held peaceable possession for nearly forty years. This 
bold action on the part of Andros aroused the blood of the Con- 
necticut settlers, who were determined to hold every foot of land 
covered by their charter, and so impressed the would-be usurper 
with their firmness that he abandoned the scheme and went on 
his way for that time, but to appear in another i'61e at a later 
date. Therefore, in view of the whole situation, it does not at 
this writing seem strange that when Andros came again to take 
from them, as they believed, the rights they enjoyed under the old 
charter the people should express their indignation and distrust. 
Many of these gentlemen were earnest and outspoken, even 
using words of contempt for those who were in authority under 
Andros. Governor Treat, who felt the rebuke most keenly, was 
determined that the dignity of the office should be maintained ; 
therefore, as a warning to those who would speak ill of their 
superiors, an order was issued for the arrest of Benjamin Crane, 
Jr., he perhaps having been the most forcible or severe in his 
criticism. 

Thus the persecution of Benjamin Crane was instituted, he 
avoiding arrest on the ground of want of jurisdiction. Those 
claiming authority had received commissions from Andros, he 
had been deposed, and they had thrown up their commissions ; 
and the question, whether or not there had been a legal election to 
reinstate the present otticials, had not, in the opinion of many 
people, been fairly settled. 

A brief account is given in the following language : " The Court 
being informed that Benjamin Crane of Wethersrield had spoken 
some hard words of those gentlemen who had thrown up their 
commissions, &c, as if they were perjured, &c, they thought there 
was cause for slander or defamation, so issued a warrant to bring 
him into court. He resolved not to fall into their hands, 
absconded, so issued a special rit warrant as they called it to a 
man that was no officer to take a file of musketeers (musqueteers) 
and break open his house and serch for him there and apreheud 
Benjamin Crane and bring him into court. The honest man 
with the warrant did not know what to do. The people were 
enraged, and he was liable to be imprisoned if he did not act. 
So he sends Benjamin notice of it, and then goes with soldiers to 
the house. Benjamin's wife being big with child near her time, 
and naturally afraid of guns, kept the door shut against them, 
and told them her husband was not in the house. But while 
their leader was at the other end of the house some of the com- 
pany fetched a log to break the door. She, not thinking they 
would break in the door, sat where she was near to it. Her 
brother, seeing them bring the log, told his sister; she no sooner 
removed than the log came violeutlv against the door and break

it, anrl in they rushed with their arms, frightening her almost to 
death. Some of the men were ashamed, others very impudent. 
They found not Benjamin. This woman, though young and nat- 
urally robust, on account of the fright had a long and severe 
delivery, and a long infirmity after it." 

This attempt to apprehend Mr. Crane must have been made in 
the autumn of 1690. 

In the court records we find the following : 

Cocrt Hartford, Nov. 28, 1690. 
Col. Roet. Treat, Esq., Governor. 
Whereas the court October last had complaint made to them of 
Benjamin Crane of his notorious obsine speaking against the 
authority's. The said court ordered that as soon as they may, call 
him to account, and punish him for the same, which by the court 
was attended to, and the court called said Crane to appear before 
them, and showed him his charge which was for saving the 
authority was a company of fore sworn wretches, that it was not 
of the King nor of God but of the Divile, which he aeknowledth 
in his passion he did say, and also his wishing himself anethema 
maranatha and that his soule may perish to all eternity if he sub- 
mitted to this government which was testified against him which 
he acknowledged he submitted to the testimonie, and the court 
having considered the case and the circumstances thereof Do 
judge him worthy of severe punishment as could lie well laid 
upon him, yet willing to be favorable as may be, Do sentance 
the said Benjamin Crane to pay a fine of £15 to the treasurer of 
this country and that the said Crane be committed to prison there 
to continue till the said 15 lbs is paid and at his release he is to 
give a £50 bond with sufficient security or sureties for his good 
behavior till the court in March next and that then he appear and 
take up his bond. The marshall was ordered upon his denyal of 
submitting to the servace of the court to convey said Crane to 
the common goale (and have his mittemus with him)." 
The court, held Nov. 28, 1690, was made up as follows: 
Col. Robert Treat, Esq., Governor, 
Samuel Willys, 
William Joanes, 
Lt. Col. Jno. Allyn, 
Capt. Samuel Talcott, 
William Pitkin, 
Nathaniel Stanley. 
Judging from the following court record Benjamin Crane paid 
his tine of fifteen pounds, but did not appear before the court 
iu March, 1691, and may not have been strictly on his good 
behavior, for his brother John Crane, who signed Benjamin's 
bond, was called upon to pay the fifty pounds. 
April 8, 1691. 
The court ordered " that the clerk of the court do inform John 



SECOND GENERATION. 21 

Crane that they require that he return Benjamin Crane to prison, 
that he do it within two days, and in failure thereof the court 
resolve to take the forfeiture of his bond." 
April 25, 1691. 

"John Crane being called three times to appear in court and to 
bring his brother Benjamin according to his bond. He appeared 
not. so his bond of £50 is forfeited to the country treasury." 

It is a fact worthy of notice that these brothers both died 
young, and soon after this rather unfortunate political entangle- 
ment; Benjamin was drowned June 20, 1603, and John died Oct. 
21, 1694. 

14. Liect. Jonathan Crane 3 [3], (Benjamin 1 ), married Deb- 
orah Griswold, daughter of Francis Griswold, Dec. 19, 1678. She 
was born May, 1661, and died about 1704. Mr. Griswold was in 
Windsor in 1649. Went, from there to Saybrook, and from 
thence, about 1660, to Norwich, where he was among the most 
enterprising of the early settlers. Was called of Windham, Nor- 
wich and Lebanon. He died June 6, 173.5. He was one of the 
first settlers of Windham, Conn., erecting the first sawmill in the 
town. Mr. Weaver says he was known as a blacksmith in 1715. 

Dec. 11, 1690, he purchased of John Calkins of Norwich 1000 
acres right in S. E. Quarter No. 2. He was at that time called 
of Norwich. 

October, 1606, he was appointed one of the Overseers of the 
estate of Robert Wade. Appointed by the Assistants a Lieu- 
tenant October, 1703. Was chosen Deputy to the General Court 
from Windham 1701. 1703, 1705, 1707 to 1714, 1717. 1718, 1721 
and 1722. Children :

At the first public meeting of the settlers of Windham, Conn., 
held May 18, 1601, Jonathan Craue was one of the four persons 
directed to run the town lines, which work had been accom- 
plished by May 28, at which time another meeting was held, and 
he with Joshua Kipley and Jonathan Giuniugs were chosen to 
make division of the meadows at four shillings per day for their 
services. During the summer he built and set in operation bis 
grist-mill, which was on the site of what is now known as 
Brigham's Mills.

22 CRANE GENEALOGY. 

Jonathan Crane with ten others petitioned the General Court 
sittiug at Hartford, Oct. 6, i69l, to grant them a Town charter, 
the town to be called Windham. The petition was granted May 
12, 1692. At the first public town meeting, held June 12, 1692, 
Mr. Crane was elected one of the "Townsmen," and at the same 
meeting he with Thomas Huntington were directed to take meas- 
ures for securing a minister. Their efforts were not crowned with 
success until September of that year, when they agreed with Mr. 
Samuel Whiting to come and carry on the ministry in that town. 
He preached his first sermon there January 1, 1693, and the people 
were so well pleased with him that they ratified the agreement 
and chose Samuel Roberts and Jonathan Crane '■ to discourse 
with him." He was directed to go with two others "to set to 
rights the lots at the Ponds," also one of three persons appointed 
" Collectors" to levy and gather rate. He resided on the "Hither 
Place," now Windham Centre. Was on committee to provide a 
convenient place for a burying ground ; also to run the town 
lines with Mr. Joshua Ripley and three others. In May, 1695, 
he was chosen Ensign of a military company, and commissioned 
Ensign by the General Court in October of that year. January 
i, 1695, Mr. Crane exchanged property with Sergt. Wm. Backus, 
giving his grist-mill and receiving a new dwelling-house in Wind- 
ham, situated on the house and home lot of Mr. Backus, four 
acres of meadow lying on the Nochog path by the brook to the 
little pine swamp, and one acre of meadow in the five-acre 
meadow. This house and lot was on what was called the Hither 
Place, and April 11, 1695, Mr. Crane sold it to Exercise Conant, 
who sold it about one year later to John Abbe of Wenham for 
£70 silver. In 1696 the town built a house for their minister, 
Mr. Whitney. The work, except building the chimneys, was ac- 
complished by the townspeople, led in four separate companies 
or squads, Ensign Crane taking the lead of one of them. That 
Mr. Crane was one of Windham's most active and influential 
men there can be little doubt. 

January 30, 1700, he with Rev. Samuel Whiting purchased the 
front portion of William Backus's home lot, it being eight by 
twenty rods square, and gave it to the town for a " meeting-house 
plat or common." This lot was afterwards called " Windham 
Green," and here the first meeting-house was erected. In 1698 
he with Mr. Huntington purchased in behalf of the proprietors 
of Windham a tract of land containing about ten thousand acres, 
lying between Windham and Norwich, and west of the "Nip- 
muck Path," called the " Mamosyneage lands." In the year 
1700 this tract was made over to Rev. Samuel Whiting and 
Jonathan Crane. They took the whole, care of laying it out into 
lots and selling them to settlers. Lieut. Daniel Mason publicly 
made claim to this land on Training-day in Windham, May 13, 
1701, he having received a deed of it from one of the pretended 
Indian owners. But the following September the General Court 



SECOND GENERATION. 23 

ratified and confirmed the purchase of Crane and Whiting, and 
granted them a patent, thus preventing further controversy as to 
the rightful ownership of this tract of land. In the year 1700 
Lieut. Crane received permission from the Court at Hartford 
" to keep a public victualing house for the entertainment of trav- 
elers and strangers, and the retailiug of strong drink." Also 
appointed by the General Court to view Plainfield and see best 
place to erect a meeting-house ; chosen on committee to see the 
miller and regulate the grinding of corn, it not being satisfac- 
tory. October, 1701, on committee to run the town line; 
October 20, 1702, on committee to see to completing the meeting- 
house, and April 19, 1703, on committee to arrange the seating 
of the same. This same year the town agreed to have but " one 
ordinary, Lieut. Crane to keep it," and the General Court com- 
missioned him Lieutenant. In 1704 he was on committee to run 
out the line "from Appaynage to the southeast corner of the 
town and c." 

The Indian war broke out afresh in 1704, and Windham reor- 
ganized her military company for the protection of the inhabit- 
ants. John Fitch was chosen Captain. Jonathan Crane Lieu- 
tenant, and Joseph Cary Ensign. Although the people at this 
time became somewhat alarmed, no serious inconvenience was 
experienced. In 1705 Mr. Crane was one of a committee to 
have charge of all town lands ; to call meetings to vote on any 
matters necessary, and to sign the acts to lay out highways, &c. 
In 1713 the town voted to enlarge the meeting-house, and ap- 
propriated £40 to pay for doing the work. The matter was, 
however, reconsidered, and the subject finally disposed of by 
deciding to build a new house of worship to meet the demands 
of the rapidly increasing population. Deacons Cary, Brigham 
and Lieut. Crane were chosen a committee to agree with the 
workmen, Mr. Crane to serve as treasurer. The work was speed- 
ily and successfully accomplished, the new building having been 
erected on the site of the old one. In the year 1715 he served 
on a committee to settle the question whether or not to allow the 
north parish (Canada) to form a separate religious society. 
After careful consideration of the matter, the prayer of the 
petition was granted. In 1726 Jonathan Crane, Joshua Riplev 
and John Fitch were chosen as representatives of the breth- 
ren to act with the newly appointed deacons to constitute the 
" seven pillars " or councillors of the church. These men were 
recommended to the pastor, to be called together by him for 
consultation whenever occasion demanded. Mr. Crane was one 
of the first set of jurymen empaneled in the County of Windham 
at the first Court of Common Pleas, holdeu June 2(5, 172(5. It is 
reasonable to suppose that more than one occasion demanded the 
attention of this constituted arm of the Church, the "seven 
pillars." But we will quote but one, Xov. 13, 1728: "Whereas. 
the work and business of the pastor of a Church is very great. 



-i CRANE GENEALOGY. 

and particularly the enquiring iuto scandal and procuring evi- 
dence, and whereas, the Scripture informs us <that God has set 
some in the Church to be helps in the government, voted, That it 
shall be the work of the Representatives of the Bretheren, and 
they are hereby desired, with all diligence, to attend upon it. 
That when there is a public and common report that any person 
belonging to the congregation hath committed any public scan- 
dalous evil, to enquire into such report and bring information 
and evidence to the pastor, provided that this be not understood 
to hinder the pastor from taking cognizance of any scandal that 
may otherwise clearly come to his knowledge, nor to hinder any 
private brother from bringing a complaint whenever there be oc- 
casion for it." 

The following was taken from the records of Wethersfield : 
••July 3, 1734 : Jonathan Crane of Lebanon Windham Co for the 
love &c. I have for my two grandsons as follows John Crane of 
Wethersfield and Abiah Crane of Windham, I give in equal part 
or share all my right or interest in any lot or lotment of land 
in Wethersfield. Acknowledged before Jonathan Huntington, 
Justice." 

This John and Abiah were brothers and the two eldest children 
of Jonathan's son John. 

The inscription upon the headstone over his grave in the 
cemetery at Lebanon, Conn., reads as follows : " Here lies Mr 
Jonathan Crane husband of Mrs Deborah Crane who lived a 
pious and Godly life and left y° earth for heaven March y c 12"' 
Ano c 1735, and in y e 77 th year of his age." 

25. Joseph Crane 2 [4], { Benjamin 1 ), married Sarah, daughter 
of John Kilborne. Dec. 10, 1684. He died Nov. 28, 1707. 
aged 46 years. At the distribution his estate was given to 
his wife and children, as mentioned, "Benjamin, Isaac, Susan 
Pool, Hannah Purple, and Ester Crane." His widow married 
Mr. Leonard, and, Sept. 2, 1718, Joseph Talcott, Esq., Judge, 
appointed this Mrs. Leonard of Wethersfield guardian of her 
children, Esther, about 1*3, she desiring the same, and Isaac, about 
11, she giving the necessary bond for £100. 

Had land given him by his father Jan. 12, 1683, and acknowl- 
edged March 5 that year. It was located near south end of 
•■ Rocky Hill." in Wethersfield, on the highway towards Middle- 
town. 

He purchased of his brother Jacob 4^ acres of land located on 
••Bever Brook," receiving the deed Oct. 9, 1696. Lot No. 163 
on Connecticut River fell to him in the distribution of town lots. 
Aug. G, 1697, he purchased a lot containing 24 acres of Michael 
Griswold. He also owned 21 acres at or near "Tappin's hill " 
Sarah, widow of Joseph Crane, late of Wethersfield, exhibited an 
Inventory of the estate Jan. 5, 1707, and was appointed adminis- 
tratrix. Abraham Kilborne had been appointed guardian for 



SECOND GENERATION. ZO 

Joseph's son Benjamin. Kilborne having died, Benjamin, aged 
about 16, asked the Court, March 17, 1712-13, to appoint John 
Wright as guardian, which was done. April 16, 1714, Benjamin 
asked to have Abraham Morrison of Wethersfiekl appointed 
guardian, and that was done. 

May 12, 1709, widow was allowed to sell land to pay debts 
against the estate, and October, same year, again allowed to sell 
laud to pay debts, and save movable property so she and the chil- 
dren could subsist. 

Feb. 5, 1710-11, the Court granted further time to Sarah, 
widow and administratrix, to administer the estate. June 7, 
171-4, Sarah Leonard reported on estate of Joseph Crane, whole 
amount £233 — — 6. She was to have one-third, and each child 
their part. June 8, 1714, this appears: "Whereas, the adminis- 
tratrix of the estate of Joseph Crane, late of Wethersfiekl, is 
married and moved out of this government, the Court granted 
letters of administration to Joseph Kilbourn of Wethersfiekl, 
which he accepted and gave bonds." 

Jan. 18, 1714-15, Abraham Morris was added to administer 
this estate. May 28, 1715, reported not enough movable prop- 
erty to pay the debts. July 5, 1715, Court ordered 9 — 6 — 10 of 
land to be sold to pay debts. 

Joseph Crane, freeman, of Fairfield, Conn., March 18, 1689-

going there later, as early as 1715.

Jonathan to Windham, and built a house there 1691-2. Was a 
blacksmith by trade. He returned, however, to Wethersfield, 
and succeeded to his father's business as tanner. He drew land

SECOND GENERATION. 27 

eighteen acres of land in Great Westfield in Wethersfield, his 
brother Benjamin signing a release of the same, under date of 
July 27, 1692. This was witnessed by their- brother John Crane. 
Not many years afterward he removed to Fairfield ; for he re- 
newed his covenant with the Church there (Stratfield Parish), 
town of Fairfield, Feb. 8, 1697 ; and his wife Mary was admitted 
to full communion there Oct. 22, 1699. Juue 1, 1699, Mr. Crane, 
then of Fairfield, took a deed of 18 acres of laud at " Toylsome,"

103. Joseph Crane 3 [21], (Jonathan. -Benjamin 1 ). Born in 
Windham, Coun. When the new meeting-house was built 
there, he, with a few other young men, in the year 1713, built a 
pew for their own use. Just the date he left Windham does not 
appear, but he evidently while a young man followed his uncles 
Joseph and Elijah Crane to Fairfield, where he married ai out 
the year 1719 Mary, daughter of Samuel Couch of that place. 
She was born Dec. 15, 1095. Mr. Couch gave his son-in-law 
property in Fairfield, deed dated Sept. 8, 1725. It will be seen 
by referring to the notice of Joseph Crane's uncle Elijah that 
after the death of this uncle, Benjamin, his youngest son, was iu 
1727 made the ward of Capt. Samuel Couch of Fairfield. This 
Joseph Crane in 1725 took an inventory of the estate of John 
Allen of Fairfield. But later he appears to have removed to 
Norwalk, and from there to the place now known as South East. 
Putnam County, N. Y., locating in the town last mentioned about 
the year 1730 on the north side of "Joe's Hill," about one mile 
and a half east of Sodom Corners, where ou the east branch 
of the Croton River he built " Crane's Mill." The site of 
this mill is now covered by the Sodom Reservoir. Miss Kate 
Crane, a descendant in this line, writes that recently an old Eng- 
lish clock has beeu found in South East with the following mark 
inside the case :" Joseph Crane, 1(520." This clock may have 
been a wedding present, and ought ever to be retained in the 
possession of the Crane family. Counterfeit money was reported 
in circulation quite early in the history of this new country ; but 
Joseph Crane was among those who were completely exonerated 
from any connection or knowledge of the matter, as will be seen 
from the following :

August 20, 1781. The following dates of births and deaths

third of the whole estate during her natural life ; Sarah Tooley, 
Hannah Purple, Esther Crane and Isaac Crane, younger children 
of Joseph, deceased, single portions. The distributers were 
Edward Bulkley, Capt. Ephraim Goodrich and Jonathan Smith. 

There was a debt due from this estate of Joseph Crane to his 
brother Jacob Crane. Possibly the following sale was for the 
purpose of cancelling that debt, or a portion of it, for Benjamin 
agreed to pay his uncle a debt which was due. 

January 28. 1717-8, this Benjamin Crane sold to his uncle 
Jacob Crane for £31 — 7 — 0, 44, acres of land in what was called

Joseph Kilborn of said town, and that she had received her 
estate, and Joseph Kilborn's bond was discharged.

40 CRANE GENEALOGY. 

Whether Silas Crane was a soldier under Sir Wm. Pepperell of 
Kittery Point, Me., in the expedition that captured Louisbourg in 
June, 1745, we do not know of a certainty. But certain we are 
that he was attracted, as were many others, to that spot known 
and remembered as Acadia, that region made famous by the 
muse of Longfellow, and where the broad acres and fertile fields 
which those French exiles had been forced to abandon were 
ready to welcome the new hand that should come to toil within 
their borders. Connecticut furnished her quota of men for that 
expedition, and ever after that 17th day of June, when M. 
Chambon, governor of Louisbourg, surrendered to Commodore 
P. Warren and Sir Wm. Pepperell, some of those undisciplined 
soldiers, as they were called by the regulars, turned their eyes 
occasionally in the direction of that fair country which had so 
generously been offered them by the English government. 

Although the right to control these lands had passed back 
and forth at various times, 1621 to 1755, between France and 
England, quite a French population were still residents there, 
and, siding as they naturally did with the Indians against the 
English, became a constant source of alarm and a serious 
obstruction to progress among the New England settlements. 
At last a determination was formed to get rid of them if possi- 
ble. To that end an expedition was planned, with Sir Wm. 
Pepperell at its head. Lt.-Col. Wm. Vaughn of Portsmouth, 
N. H., has the distinction of having proposed the scheme of 
taking Cape Breton to Gov. Wm. Shirley, who immediately ap- 
proved it. Mr. Vaughn traveled through the several provinces 
securing subscriptions of money and engaging men to enlist in 
the enterprise. Although a resolution was passed by a majority 
vote in the assembly of Massachusetts Bay Jan. 25, 1744-51, 
favoring a movement, all preliminaries were worked quite secretly. 
Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Connecticut, 
New Hampshire and Massachusetts were called upou to furnish 
men and means, Connecticut sending about 500 men toward the 
nearly 4000 furnished by the colonies to act in conjunction with 
Commodore Sir Peter Warren, then commanding his majesty's 
fleet, stationed along the Atlantic coast, then at West Indies. 
Enlistments began February 2, and by the latter part of the 
following month 3000 men were on the way to Canso. They were 
followed by others, and April 30 the army was drawn up before 
Louisbourg demaudiug its surrender. Steady constant work was 
put in step by step, the lines were tightened, until June 16 the 
stronghold succumbed, and the following day the French gov- 
ernor surrendered to Commodore Peter Warren and Sir Wm. 
Pepperell, after a siege of 49 days. It was a great victory. It 
gave to New England a certain degree of security which hitherto 
she had not known, and opened the way for developing her out- 
lying settlements. The newly conquered territory also became a 
prize for those who were desirous of receiving a share in the 



FOURTH GENERATION". 41 

spoils of war. Lord Halifax formed a project by which the 
English colony of Nova Scotia might be augmented, and in 1749, 
after being adopted by the government, was set in motion, and 
the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations issued in 
March of that year a proclamation by which 50 acres of land was 
offered to every soldier and sailor who would settle in that part 
of America, free of rent for 10 years, and not more than one 
shilling per annum for the 50 acres afterwards. To every sol- 
dier and sailor who had a wife and children 10 acres more were 
offered for every individual in his family, and for every increase 
that should afterwards happen to the family; to each subaltern 
officer 80 acres, and 15 more for each of his family, 200 acres to 
each ensigu, 300 to each lieutenant, 400 to captain, 600 to each 
officer in rank above captain, and 30 acres more for each person 
in his household. The government also engaged to transport 
and maintain the new settlers one year at its own expense, to 
furnish them with such arms, provisions, utensils, implements 
and tools as necessary to put them in condition to clear and cul- 
tivate their lands, build habitations, and commence a fishery. 
Carpenters and other handicraftsmen were offered same oppor- 
tunities as soldiers and sailors ; surgeons were to receive same as 
ensigns. Within two months 3750 persons embarked and located 
the place called Halifax, and for several years government 
expended large sums of money annually to assist settlers in 
locating in Nova Scotia. The increase in population was so 
rapid that in July, 1755, the French that had held on, not being 
willing to give up all, saw that it was of no use to further con- 
tend, and abandoned their possessions, and left the country quite 
free to the English settlers, and the people of Connecticut as 
well as other provinces were encouraged to try their fortunes in 
this new country. About the year 1751 the people of Norwich, 
Conn., entered into the coastwise trade, building of ships, &c, 
which opened up communication with Nova Scotia, and many of 
the people about the eastern portion of Connecticut were 
anxious to possess some of the abandoned farms left by the 
exiled Acadiaus, and Silas Crane with his family were among the 
number. In 1760 he with his son Silas drew certain lots in the 
township of Horton — one of 50 acres marked A No. 2, located 
in Wolfville, about three miles from Grand Pre; he also drew a 
town lot, one-half acre and three farm lots. Nos. 2S9, 290 and 291. 
Silas. Jr., drew farm lot No. 292. These four lots contained 
245 acres each, and adjoined the river. 

They also had other lauds set off to them in the first division, 
record of which was made in a book which has since been 
burned. Mr. James Leard, government surveyor for Kings 
county, 1891, writes: "We know that a majority of the first 
settlers came from Connecticut ; 240 came very soon after the 
expulsion of the Acadians. and it is said many of them were with 
Sir Wm. Pepperell at the takimr of Louisboura: in 1745." Another

company of settlers, including Col. Noble of Boston, being 
attracted thither in 1755, were surprised by the French, and the 
colonel, with his two lieutenants and some 70 men, were killed. 
Mr. James Leard remembers when a boy (many years ago) 
James Noble Crane, son of Jonathan, who pointed out to him the 
spot on his (Leard's) farm where Col. Noble and his two 
lieutenants were buried between two old French apple trees ; but 
the trees have now disappeared, and nothing remains to mark the 
spot where they were laid to rest. 

In August, 1760, it was claimed that 6000 people from Ameri- 
can settlements, principally from Long Island and Connecticut, 
had recently settled in Nova Scotia. Among the names of those 
who settled with the Cranes there we find those of John Allen, 
John Allen. Jr., Jas. Anderson, John Atwell, Benj. Beckwith, 
Derius, Elisha and Jacob Brown, William, Peter and John 
Bishop, Sr., and John Bishop, Jr., Obed Benjamin, Timothy 
Bishop, Richard and Christopher Best, Andrew Belcher, John 
Burbidge, Jeremiah Calkin, Sr. and Jr., Benj. Cleveland, Wm. 
Coldwell, John and Jonathan Davidson, Nathan, Jehial and 
Simeon DeWolfe, Daniel Dodge, Andrew and David Sherman, 
Robert, William, Samuel Deunison, and their father. Col. Robert 
Denuisou, who went from Norwich. Conn., and were at the siege 
of Louisbourg, John Eagles, James, Jonathan and Joseph Elder- 
kin, Benjamin Fitch, Wm. Foster, Col. Foster, Noah, Amos and 
Nathan, Sr, and Jr., Gilbert, and Timothy Forsythe, Samuel

Of course it will be noticed that they were not "refugees." 
They did not leave their country to escape the results of the 
Revolutionary war. as many others did during that eventful 
period in American history, but removed to Nova Scotia many 
years prior to the Revolution, and when that event came it found 
them in quite different circumstances. Their environments were 
of quite another sort. Many if not all of them were living 
under patronage of the mother country. They had been given 
special privileges under the crown in the possession of their lauds, 
and therefore, as honorable men, were under obligation to stand

214. Capt. Joseph Crane 4 [105], (Joseph, 3 Jonathan, 2 Ben- 
jamin 1 ), married Esther Belden. She was born Oct. 31, 1 727, 
and daughter of Samuel Belden. He was a resident of South 
East, N. Y., and lived and died on the old homestead, and a 
physician and judge in Duchess Co. 16 years. She died Feb. 
27, 1786, aged 58. " He died Oct. 14, 1800, aged 78. He owned 
a large tract of land situated in South East ; also some adjoining- 
it, but over the line in Connecticut. It was called "Joe's Hill." 
At the foot of this hill, located on the Croton River, stood 
"Crane's Mill," built by his father. Dates of births and deaths 
of this family were furnished by Carso Crane from the family 
Bible. 

Feb. 24, 1776, Joseph Crane memorialized the New York 
delegates in Continental Congress, and the same was received 
Feb. 26, in which attention was called to his services in the last 
campaign, and praying the care of an artillery company. After 
the memorial had been read, action on the same was post- 
poned until the appointment of artillery officers was resumed. 
March 16 he was appointed Captain Lieutenant to serve in the 
Artillery Company whereof .John Grinnell is Captain, on his 
(Joseph Crane) producing a certificate that he has been ex- 
amined and is duly qualified.! 

" Head Quarters New York April 9 1776 a certificate from 
S. Badlam Capt of Artillery dated 8th instant was read and filed. 
He hereby certifies that he has examined Joseph Crane as to his 
knowledge in gunnery and considering his merits and experience.

thiuks him qualified for a Captain Lieutenancy. Therefore or- 
dered, that the said Joseph Crane pursuant to the order of the 
provincial Congress of the 16th of March last be Capt Lieutenant 
of the Continental Company of Artillery whereof Sebastian 
Beauman Esq is Captain." 

Dr. Crane was one of the most prominent men in the county 
during the Revolutionary war. Was Chairman of the South 
East Precinct Committee in 1775 and 1777; also one of the 
Supervisors in 1773, 1787 and 1789. Was it this Dr. Crane or 
his son that was ordered by the Provincial Congress, Sept. 17, 

1776, with Mr. Duane, Mr. Duer and Mr Schenck, to inquire 
into the situation of the Light Horsemen and Lieut. Onderdonck, 
and report thereon? 

From the wording of the above memorial to the Continental 
Congress by Joseph Crane we understand he had rendered his 
country service at some prior date, and in New York Colonial 
MSS., Vol. LXXXV., page 132, may be found the following: 

••Muster Roll of a company of Provincials in y e pay of y e

Col. Thaddeus Crane served in the war of the Revolution. Was

(also captain of North Salem company) ; major Sept. 29, 1780. 
April 26 he was shot through the hip during the engagement at 
Ridgefield, Conn, (expedition to Danbury), and he asked the 
Honorable Council to reimburse him for loss of time, costs, &c.

was at great expense by loss of time and cost of doctor, I desire 
to know from your Honorable Council whether I am to receive 
any wages or relief from the State, and where to apply to get 
the same if any is allowed. These from your Honor's humble 
servant. 

To Honorable Council of Safety 

State of New York. Thaddeus Crane ."* 

Nearly nine years later the legislature of New York passed. 
April 22, 1786, an act making provisions for officers, soldiers 
and seamen, who had been disabled in the service of the United 
States. 

The payment of pensions to the soldiers of New York and 
other States began, according to the '-Ledger Rev. Accounts." 
March, 1782. '• Crane, Thaddeus, major (Col. Thomas' militia), 
shot through the body; expedition to Danbury, April 27, 1777." 

It will be noticed that his petition to the Honorable Council of 
New York states that he was shot April 26, while subsequent 
entries give it as April 27. 

According to published accounts! we learn that Danbury, 
Conn., was, in the latter part of the year 1776, selected by the 
commissioners of the American army as a place of deposit for mili- 
tary stores, and at this time, April, 1777, large quantities of pork, 
flour, beef, grain, rum, wine, rice, tents, army carriages, besides 
other valuable articles, had been collected here, and Gov. Tryon, 
at the head of 2000 men from New York, proceeded by sailing 
vessel to Fairfield, and landing there Friday, April 25, during the 
afternoon and night, marched the next day, the 26th. to Dan- 
bury, where they arrived at two o'clock in the afternoon. Tryon 
and his soldiers were met here by a small detachment of Conti- 
nental troops, who were, owing to the vastly superior number of 
thr British, obliged to evacuate the town ; not, however, until 
they had secured or removed a considerable quantity of stores 

"Correspondence of the Provincial Congress, Vol. II.. page 4'J9.

and provisions ; and it would appear from the reading of Col. 
Thaddeus Crane's petition that it was in the act of holding the 
enemy at bay and in attempting to save some of these stores 
from destruction that he received his wound. The next day, 
April 27th, early in the morning Tryon and his men set fire to the 
buildings, and immediately marched from the town on their way 
back to their vessel, the object of their expedition having been 
accomplished. Of course a general alarm had been givefn snon 
as the enemy appeared at Fairfield, and Brigadier-General 
Sillirnan, with about five hundred militia, immediately started in 
pursuit of the enemy. They were joined at Reading with Major- 
General Wooster and Brigadier-General Arnold, but the wet con- 
dition of the roads prevented the Continentals from reaching the 
enemy until Tryon was on his way back to his vessel, about 
eleven o'clock in the forenoon, April 27, when General Wooster 
and his men held a smart skirmish with the enemy, and Wooster 
was shot through the groin. General Arnold also came up about 
the same time with his command and engaged the enemy, and a 
lively action lasting about an hour occurred. Arnold's horse was 
shot from under him, but the general, recovering himself, drew his 
pistol and shot the soldier who was advancing on him with fixed 
bayonet. The Continentals could do no more than fall back and 
harass Tryon and his men until they succeeded the next day, 
April 28th, in reaching their vessel and setting sail for Long 
Island. Notwithstanding the fact that the Continental troops 
succeeded in saving some of the stores deposited at Danbury, 
there was a large quantity destroyed, a careful estimate placing 
the loss* at 3000 barrels of pork, something over 1000 ban-els 
flour, several hundred barrels beef, 1(300 tents, 2000 bushels of 
grain, besides quantities of rum, wine, rice, army carriages, &c. 
Nineteen dwellings, a meeting-house, twenty-two stores and 
barns were burned. The loss of men on the American side was 
judged to have been about sixty killed and wounded. The Brit- 
ish loss was more than double that number ; also about twenty 
prisoners. Thaddeus Crane was captain in the Westchester 
County militia under Col. Thomas Thomas, receiving his com- 
mission in 1775; afterwards second major, 2d Regt., 1775, and 
lieutenant-colonel Feb. 17, 1780, 4th Regt., Westchester County. 
He was delegate to the New York State Constitutional Conven- 
tion in 1788, and voted for adoption of the Constitution. He 
was delegate to the New York Legislature 1777, 1778, 1779 ; 
member of the New York Assembly (Provincial Congress) in 
1777-9, 1788, 1789. His sword is retained in the hands of his 
grandson, Thaddeus Crane of Somers, N. Y. The old Crane 
homestead is at North Salem, Westchester County, N. Y., where 
Col. Thaddeus Crane lived, and where his nineteen children were 
born.

•24'.). Stephen Crane 4 [110], (Joseph, 3 Jonathan,'- Benja- 
min 1 ), married Mary Chapman, Jan. 22, 1762. She was born in 
South East, N. Y., Jan. 4, 1745. It is said her father was a 
clergyman and from Cape Cod, and settled in New Milford, 
Conn., but died May 10, 1814, at the home of his sou Joseph in 
Kent, Conn., and was buried there. April 10, 1770, he pur- 
chased a house and lot, also a blacksmith shop, hi New Milford, 
11 miles north of the meeting-house. 

He was a private in Thompson's Co., Wessenfel's Regt. ;* also 
Miller's Co., Philips' Regt., State troops, and Col. Spencer's Regt. 
Line L. B. T. 14.6.17.; also captain and commissary of artillery 
in the war of the Revolution.! His widow married Peter Smith of 
Harperstield, N. Y. She died June 24, 1824. Mr. Crane was 
chosen overseer of highways at Carrnel, at first town meeting, 
held at the house of John Crane, son of Zebulon, April 7, 17'J5, 
and this John Crane was chosen town clerk. 

Rev. Ezra F., grandson of Stephen Crane, writes; "My 
grandmother Crane was one of the grandest women of her age, a 
perfect heroine in the Revolutionary war. My grandfather was 
living at Danbury, Conn., when the British burned the town. He 
and all his men from the shop left for the fort near by, but my 
grandmother stood her ground, and stood in the door of the house 
when the British officer rode up, who had his men search the 
house ; finding she was alone, no men near, caused a guard to be 
placed around the house till the army passed, and thus saved her 
house." She was daughter of Isaac and Mary (Paddock) Chap- 
man. Her father was born in Dennis, Mass., April 7, 1721, and 
settled in South East, N. Y., about the year 1740. Her mother, 
Mary Paddock, was daughter of Peter Paddock, who was born 
June 3, 1724, aud died at South East, Nov. 8, 1776. Isaac 
Chapman, father of Mrs. Crane, was son of Isaac, who was 
born in Barnstable county, Mass., Dec. 29, 1602, and grandson 
of Isaac, born Aug. 4, 1647, and great-grandson of Ralph Chap- 
man Southwark of Surrey county, England. Children :

married Capt Joshua Barnum of Danbury, Conn., and settled in 
South East, Putnam County. N. Y., in 1755. She died April 17, 
1810. Capt. Barnum was born in 1737, and died Oct. 23, 1822. 
He was an officer in the war of the Revolution, rendering valua- 
ble service ; was wounded during the engagement at "Ward's 
House," near White Plains. In battle of White Plains he took 
the lock from the door of the prison, thereby liberating a number 
of federal soldiers confined there; was wounded, taken prisoner, 
marched to New York, and confined on board one of the prison 
ships at Wallabout near Brooklyn, which ships were called 
'•Ships of Death." After a time he was released, but crippled 
with a shattered limb and the loss of sight in one eye. During 
the war the captain was necessarily absent from home much of 
the time, but the wife superintended the work on the farm while 
her boys did the work. In the meantime the son of a neighbor 
(Doty by name) who had enlisted in the army deserted, which 
fact so grieved his mother that she went to Mrs. Barnum in her 
distress of mind, and Mrs. Barnum sent her eldest son, 1(5 years 
of age, who served through one campaign as a substitute for the 
Doty boy. Children :

Capt. Oliver Hanehett's company of Suffield (10th Co.), 2d Regt. 
Vol., Col. Joseph Spencer; served in and about Boston. A por- 
tion of this regiment was engaged in battle of Bunker Hill ; en- 
listed May 11 ; discharged Dec. 17, 1775. Mr. Crane and his 
wife joined the church in 1765. March 4, 1770, he sold his home 
place to his brother-in-law Thomas Kilbey. At the time of the 
baptism of the two youngest children Mrs. Crane was a widow. 
His mother Lydia Crane says he died in camp. 

The following shows how claims were collected in the 18th 
century: "Whereas Geo. Olcott recovered judgment against 
Ruth Crane first Tuesday of Nov., 1789, for £10—18—11 and 
costs, — 17 — 11, and for want of money the officer is ordered 
to take the body of said Ruth to the Goal and put her in care of 
the keeper until she pay the full sum above mentioned. The

278. Curtis Crane' 1 [124], (John 3 , Abraham,'- Benjamin 1 ), 
enlisted Feb. 28, 1778, during the war of the Revolution, as 
private in Capt. Thos. Wopster's company, Col. Samuel B. 
Webb's regiment, which was the 3d regiment, and known as 
Additional Infantry of Connecticut Line, 1777-1781. June 1, 
1781. he was promoted to corporal in Capt. Roger Alden's com- 
pany, same regiment (3d), Additional Infantry of Connecticut 
Line of 1781-1783. Lt.-Col. Wm. S. Livingston acted as 
colonel of this regiment while Col. Webb was held as a prisoner, 
having been captured by the enemy while in command of an 
expedition against Long Island on Dec. 10. 1777, and confined 
till Jan. 1. 1781. Col. Webb's regiment after the enlistment of 
Mr. Crane was, during the summer of 1778, attached to 
Varnam's brigade, and took part in the battle of Rhode Island, 
August 29, and was complimented for its conduct at that time. 
The Regiment remained in Rhode Island until the fall of 
1779, when it proceeded to Morristown, N. J., where it passed 
the winter of 1770-1780. having been assigned to Stark's 
brigade. Lt.-Col. Ebeuezer Huntington being then in com- 
mand. June 23, 1780, was present at the battle of Spring- 
field, X. J., and during the following summer served with the 
main army on the Hudson. Col. Webb's regiment was after- 
wards styled the 9th Regiment Additional Infantry of the 
Connecticut Line, and passed the wiuter of 1780 and 1781 
with the division at camp "Connecticut Village," above the 
Robinson House on the Hudson, where it was reorganized Jan. 
1. 1781. into the 3d regiment of the Connecticut Line with the 
2d and 9th late •• Additional Infantry" regiments, formation of 
1781-1783. Col. Webb's regiment continued in service until the 
close of the war, Mr. Crane serving with it nearly five and one- 
half years, from 1778 to 1783. He received an honorable dis- 
charge, but died prior to the passage of the act of congress grant- 
ing "pensions ; his widow, however, became a pensioner, 
beginning with the year 1837, and continued to receive it up to 
the time of her death.

287. William Crane 4 [125], (John, 3 Abraham, 2 Benjamin 1 ) . 
Under date of May 27, 1773, we find the following, showing that 
he then resided in Wethersfield, Conn. : " We, Thomas Kilbey and 
wife Hannah, Curtis and William Crane, all of Wethersfield, sold 
to Capt. Chas. Churchill of Wethersfield apiece of land in Weth- 
ersfield, in the Parish of Newington, in tier No. 19, thirteen 
acres, bounded west on land of John Crane, north on land of said 
Churchill, south on land of Simon Griffin and Lydia, his wife. 
All signed this document on the above date." He was private 
in Capt. John Chester's company, lib' men, who volunteered, in 
response to the Lexington alarm, from Wethersfield : discharged 
after six days' service ; enlisted May 'Jth in Capt. John Chester's 
company ('Jth), 2d Regt. Vol., Gen. Joseph Spencer; served in 
and about Boston at time of siege; reported deserted Dec. 1, 
1775 ; private in Capt. Jonathan Wells' company, Hartford, Col. 
Erastus Wolcott's regiment, state militia ; served about Boston, 
January to March, 1776. 

It will be noticed that this William Crane is reported as 
having deserted ; but it appears from records in existence that 
a number of men entered as deserters about December 1, 
explained in petitions to the General Assembly of the Colony of 
Connecticut that they had no intention of deserting, but believing 
their time had expired on that date instead of December 10. 
The Assembly ordered them to be paid for full time. This 
William Crane was among the number. His mother, Lydia Crane, 
states in a petition at the May session of the Assembly, 1776, that 
she had three sons in the service in 1775. (They were John, Curtis 
and this William). ' -The oldest died in camp, the second returned, 
and the third, William, who had enlisted in Capt. Chester's com- 
pany, and fought at Bunker's Hill, left his regiment about 
November 30th, supposing his time to be out, but, being taken 
down with fever on the way, wandered in his delirium to Leicester, 
Mass.. and died there."* 

A careful examination of the records at Leicester, Mass., 
failed to disclose the record of the death of this William Crane; 
and it is quite probable that the good mother was misinformed at 
that time, and that her son William recovered and re-enlisted, 
being in service at the time she prepared her petition. The 
means of getting information from any considerable distance in 
those days were such that it would not be strange if conflicting 
reports had reached Wethersfield about these supposed deserters, 
and that this widowed mother, who had furnished three soldiers

for the cause of national freedom, all the sons she had, and one 
of those then deceased while in the service, was easily led to 
believe that this the youngest of her sons was dead ; but, from the 
best information at hand, it appears that after the close of 
the Revolutionary war he settled in Great Barrington, Mass. 
May 25, 1818, William Crane of that place made his will, in 
which he mentions his wife Rebecca, and grandchildren Harriet 
Grain and William Whiting Crain, "children of my late son, 
William Crain ; Albert Lewis Crain, Aurelia Loiza Crain, 
children of my late sou, Whiting Crain, deceased ;" and daugh- 
ter, Sally Crain ; his wife Rebecca to be executrix. She 
presented the will for probate June 4, 1818 Dec. 31, 1829, 
Sally Crain, the daughter, and then the only child living, peti- 
tioned the court to appoint Timothy Turner administrator for her 
mother (Rebecca Crain's) estate, she then being deceased. The 
appointment was made, and inventory filed Feb. 9, 1830, the 
total amount being eighty-eight dollars and a few cents. Rebec- 
ca died Dec. 19, 1829. Mr. Crain was a farmer and tailor by 
trade. Children :

291. Capt. Abraham Crane 4 [128], (Abraham, 3 Abraham,' 2 
Beujamin 1 ), married Mary, probably daughter of Joshua Rob- 
bins of Wethersfield, where they resided. She died May 20, 
1813, aged G7 years. He died June 29, 1808, aged 69 years. 
He united with the church Feb. 5, 1774. He was one of the 
executors of Joshua Robbins' estate, and Mary Crane was one 
of the heirs. May 15, 1808, his will was exhibited in court, and 
Abraham and Benjamiu Crane, both of Wethersfield, were named 
executors. April 26, 1809, an inventory of the estate was 
filed, amounting to $4,809.57, including 33 sides sole-leather. 
Abraham and David Crane of Wethersfield and Elijah Crane of 
Sandisfield, Berkshire County, Mass., brothers, deeded land in 
Wethersfield, Conn., to Silas Deane of Wethersfield, which be- 
longed to the heirs of Joseph Webb, deceased, March 1, 1769. 
March 25, 1771. Abraham deeds land to Wm. Loveland. Jan. 
26, 1773, David, then of Sandisfield, Mass., deeded to his brother 
Abraham land in Wethersfield, being one-half of the home lot 
that belonged to his honored father Abraham Crane, late 
deceased ; it joined land of Jedediah Sanburn, with barn stand- 
ing partly on said acre, " only reserving the right for my mother 
during her natural life." June 9, 1777, David Crane of Sandis- 
field, Mass., deeded land to Abraham that formerly belonged to 
his brother Benjamin, deceased, adjoining his mother, Rebecca's, 
land. He willed his tannery to his sons Abraham and Benjamin.

on that day he deeded land to his brother Abraham ; same lime 
his mother Rebecca released her dower by her mark [X], 
Benjamin and David being witnesses. He removed from Weth- 
ersfield to Sandislield, Berkshire County, Mass., prior to March 
1, 1769, where he carried on farming, and where he died Aug.

youngest children. Dec. 11, 1776. he deeded to his brother 
Abraham all his right, title and interest in 24 acres lying in parish

FIFTH GENERATION. 



33-4. Silas Crane 5 [1-U], (Silas, 4 Jonathan, 3 Jonathan, 2 
Benjamin 1 )- went to Horton, Nova Scotia, with his father about 
1760 and drew farm lot -292, containing 245 acres; afterwards 
resided at Economy. Said to have had a daughter. 

335—1. Grace, m. James Pineo. He was b. Aug. 2, 1777. 

33(3. Col. Jonathan Crane 5 [146], (Silas, 4 Jonathan, 3 
Jonathan,- Benjamin 1 ), went with his father from Lebanon, 
Conn., where he was born in the year 1750, to Horton, Nova 
Scotia. Married at Horton, Rebecca Allison, a native of Lon- 
donderry, Ireland. He was a magistrate, and also held a colo- 
nel's commission in the militia of the Province, and was a member 
of the Nova Scotia Parliament for the township of Horton for 
many years. It is related of him that one day coming out of 
the Government House, John Howe asked him, " What is going 
on?" "Oh," replied Crane, "'tis all a game of whist, the 
honors are divided and nothing is to be got except by tricks." 
He was on duty with his regiment one year, while stationed at 
Halifax. Col. Crane was the first person elected to represent his 
township, and continued to be re-elected until his death. He 
represented Kings County in the Provincial Parliament, and was 
in his day the most prominent man in that part of Nova Scotia. 
The house where he lived is the oldest in that part of the county, 
and was, in 1882, occupied by his grandson William Crane. 

Col. Crane was a man of more than ordinary ability, became 
very popular and was held in high esteem by all who knew him. 
Many stories are related illustrating his characteristics. Among 
them the following: " On one occasion, while the Colonel was in 
charge of protecting the people against attacks from the enemy 
to King George III., an American privateer ran in shore for the 
purpose of foraging, when the Colonel hastily collected a number 
of his townsmen, armed them from the magazine, manned the 
Parrsboro packet, and put off in hot pursuit after the privateer. 
With their six-pounder of brass they felt confident they could 
capture their game. But their valor proved much greater than 
their discretion, for the well-armed privateer soon induced them 
to surrender, and putting a prize crew on board the packet she 
was headed down the basin for Boston, much to the dismay of 
the crowd of people who had collected on shore to witness the 
affray. But the Grand Pre men were not slow to improve their 
opportunities : although the greater portion of them were fastened 



62 CRANE GENEALOGY. 

below as prisoners, several of them were depended upon to assist 
the prize crew in navigating the packet to Boston. When night 
came, William Bishop conceived a plan, which, though desperate, 
promised a chance for freedom. Having arranged matters with 
his comrades on deck, at a given signal, when there was but one 
watch on deck, Bishop dealt the steersman a blow with a marline- 
spike and threw his body into the Lazeretto, while other Grand 
Pre 1 men were taking care of the victims assigned them, fastening 
below the remaining privateersmen, and liberating their Grand 
Prd associates below hatches, thus enabling them soon to regain 
possession of the packet, which thev turned towards the basin, 
soon arriving home, to the surprise of their friends on shore, and 
acquiring no small degree of notoriety for themselves." 

At another time the Colouel was successful in outwitting John 
Thomas Hill, sheriff and customs officer. The Colonel imported 
a cask of good old Jamaica, the flavor of which he believed 
would be very much injured were the government's blighting 
stamp placed upon it. But Mr. Hill, with the usual persistency 
of a customs officer, was determined that nothing should escape 
his notice, and that the King should have his own. The Colonel 
knowing full well the alertness with which Mr. Hill executed his 
official duties, drove with great parade of stealth to Horton 
Landing, where the schooner lay. with his oxen and cart, loaded 
a cask and proceeded on his return home, when he was met by 
Officer Hill, who demanded a surrender. The Colonel submitted 
with a very bad grace, and the oxen, cart, cask and contents 
were confiscated in the king's name. The officer's disgust can 
be better imagined than described, when, upon inspection next 
morning, he found the cask contained pure water with the small- 
est snifter of rum. 

Colonel Crane had the honor of "dining and wining" his 
Royal Highness the Duke of Kent, father of the present Queen 
Victoria, while on a visit to Halifax as commander-in-chief of 
His Majesty's forces ; and the report is handed down that the 
Colonel's wife, a very estimable lady, who some now living can 
recall to mind, when informed that the Duke had brought with 
him a French lady as companion of his joys, that she made it her 
business to make sundry calls on her neighbors, thereby escaping 
an introduction to His Royal Highness and Mademoiselle Ka- 
zenksky. 

He died at Grand Pre. August, 1820. She died there in 18-41, 
aged 89 years.

350. Benjamin Crane 3 [151], (John, 4 John, 3 Jonathan. - 
Benjamin 1 ). Under date of Feb. 6, 17(32, there is a "purpose 
of marriage between Benjamin Crane of Western, Mass., and 
Sarah Witherbee who has lately dwelt at Western." The entry 
was made evidently by Simeon Dwight, then Town Clerk of that 
place, and that is all we have been able to get from the town 
records. From the office of Register of Deeds at Springfield, 
Mass., we learn that Benjamin Grain, cooper by trade, of West- 
ern, and Sarah his wife, sold land (110 acres) in Shutesbury, 
April 4, 1764. He also sold land on May 4, 1774, located in 
Merryfield (now Chester), at which time he was called of Brook- 
field. Again he sold land Jan. 16, 1777. At this time he is 
called "cooper of Western." As the family record gives evi- 
dence of twenty years residence in this locality it seems strange 
that not one at least of his children are mentioned in the records 
of either Western (now Warren) or Brookfield. From the 
archives at the State House, Boston, we learn that Benjamin 
Crane of Western was a private in Capt. Ezekiel Kuowlton's 
company. Col. Dyke's Regiment, and served from Dec. 1. 1776, 
to March 1, 1777; and from Rev. Horace Alouzo Crane, M.A., 
his great-grandson, we find he married Sarah Witherbee, March 
16, 1762." Children :

are unable to positively connect this family. Children :

360. John Crane"' [152], (John, 4 John, 3 Jonathan, 2 Ben- 
jamin 1 ). Dr. John Crane was born in Tolland. Conn. His 



66 CRANE GENEALOGY. 

mother was Rebeckah Huntington. His grandmother on the 
maternal side was Rebeckah Adgate. This relationship doubtless 
brought him into association with Eleazer Wheelock, A.M., 
D.D., sou of Deacon Ralph and Ruth (Huntington) Wheelock. 
This Ruth Huntington's mother having been Sarah Adgate, sister 
to Dr. Crane's grandmother. Mr. Wheelock was a graduate of 
Yale College in 1733, was ordained pastor of the Second Con- 
gregational Church, Lebanon, Conn., in March, 1735. He was 
very successful as a preacher and pastor. In addition to his 
ministerial charge he was greatly interested in the education of 
young men, especially the youth of the Indian nations. After 
having taken into his family several of the latter for the purpose 
of educating and training them to serve as missionaries among 
their own people, he conceived the idea of establishing and con- 
ducting a missionary school, where Indian boys might be fitted 
to perform missionary work ; and a house and two acres of land 
adjoining his own home place was given him in the year 1754 by 
Joshua Moore of Mansfield for the purpose, and the school 
established. After conducting "Moore's School," as it was 
then called, for several years, Mr. Wheelock thought the advan- 
tages might be greatly increased by changing its location and 
merging it into a college. Accordingly he obtained a charter 
from John Wentworth, then Governor of New Hampshire, and 
set out on a tour of inspection for the purpose of selecting a site 
on which to locate his college. Dr. John Crane is said to have 
accompanied Mr. Wheelock on this trip, and assisted in selecting 
Hanover, N. H., as the location. Dr. Crane removed from 
Connecticut with Rev. Eleazer Wheelock to Hanover in August, 
1770, and in 1773 built one of the first houses erected there. It 
stood on Main Street, first house south of Dartmouth Hotel. 
The house with several others was consumed by fire in Decem- 
ber, 1886. The lot, about an acre of laud, on which Dr. Crane 
built his house was presented to him by the College to encourage 
him to locate here. He was the first resident physician and 
apothecary in the place, and acquired considerable reputation as 
such. In 1776 he joined the army as surgeon and served until 
Dec. 31, 1783, serving in Col. Vose's 1st and Col. Smith's 13th 
Regiments, — Continental Army pay accounts for service from 
Oct. 24, 1777, to Dec. 31, 1779; also service from Jan. 1, 1780, 
to Dec. 31, 1780; also Lieut. Calvin Smith's 6th Regiment, wages 
allowed from January, 1781, to December, 1782, 24 months. He 
was at the battle of Saratoga, and in winter quarters at Valley 
Forge. He was a member of the Massachusetts Society of the 
Cincinnati, and was succeeded in 1809 by his son, John Hunt- 
ington Crane. Dr. Crane attended President Wheelock in his 
last sickness, when he died April 24, 1779. Oct. 15, 1784, he 
signed a petition for a road from Boscawen on Merrimack River 
to the Connecticut River. Dr. Crane married Hannah Brown, 
and died in February, 1786. His widow married Col. Aaron 
Kinsman also a Revolutionary soldier. She died in 1817.

361. Elijah Crane 5 [154], (John, 4 John, 3 Jonathan, 2 Ben-

Mass. Mr. Crane was one of the first ten settlers of the town 
of Washington, Mass., going there in 1760, — from 1762 until 
1777 the place was called Hartwood, — and with the exception of 
two years spent his life there. Jan. 30, 1772, he was appointed 
to settle his brother Amos Crane's estate of Tolland, Conn., and 
gave £200 bond to the court for faithful performance of the 
trust. Elijah was then called of Hartwood, Mass. Amos is 
said to have been killed by the Indians. Shortly before his 
death he removed to Madrid. N. Y., at which place he died Jan. 
1.3, 1818. His widow died in Canton, St. Lawrence County, 
N. Y., Sept. 11. 1819, aged 70 years. Children:

Abel Crain of Becket served as private in Capt. Ebenezer Web- 
ber's company. Lt.-Col. Saml. Williams' Regiment, Dec. 17, 
1776, discharged March 20. 1777. Marched to the northward, 
probably in Major Clap's Regiment. He again served in Capt. 
Porter's company, Col. Rositer's Regiment. From July 1 to Dec. 
31, 1779, he served as private in Major's company, Col. Ebenezer 
Sprout's Regiment, Continental army, for the town of Becket. He 
was a powerfully built man, "six feet two or three inches tall, dark 
complexion, black hair, about thirty years of age." This we learn 
from the description list of men who served in Continental army. 
A visit to the office of Registrar of Probate at Pittsfield. Mass., 
disclosed the fact that May 31, 1817, on petition of the widow 
Elizabeth Crane, George Conant, Esq., was appointed by the 
court to settle the estate of Abel Crane of Becket. Some of the 
children were minors, and Timothy Snow was appointed guardian 
for Edward and Saloma. The estate was settled Sept. 7, 1819, 
and after the payment of all debts, the widow was given her 
portion, and the balance remaining, thirty-three dollars and fifty-

Revolutionary war that separated the then thirteen colonies from 
the government of Great Britain. At the commencement of that 
war, the people were divided into two classes, — Whigs and 
Tories. The Whig party were those who were opposed to the 
black arts of the British Parliament ; and the Tories took 
sides with the king. My grandfather was then about eighty years 
old, very strong and active for a man of that age, and a warm 
Whig ; and, what is very remarkable, his eight children were all 
living, and heads of families. He had many grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren, and not an individual, who had arrived at

the years of understanding, failed to take an active part in the 
American cause. I was the eldest grandchild, and had an 
ensigu's commission under King George III.*, in the year 1775. 
I took a captain's commission under the Provincial Congress of 
the Province of New York, and on the fourth of July following, 
our Independence was declared, Clinton became our Gov- 
ernor, then I received a commission from him, and held it 
through the war. Such was the general conduct of the family, 
which was the cause of many of them receiving both Civil and 
Military commissions ; not on account of our extraordinary 
abilities, but as recognition of our engagedness in that blessed 
cause. I hope whoever reads the foregoing will erase the incor- 
rectness as I want but sis days of being eighty-three years of 
age and am almost blind." 

(Signed) "John Crane." 

Judge John Crane, or Capt. John as he is frequently spoken 
of, was the eldest of twelve children of Zebulon and Sarah Bel- 
den Crane. On March I, 1764. be married Tamar, daughter of 
John and Hannah Carpenter of New Castle, Westchester Co., 
N. Y. Five years later, with his wife and two small children, 
he came from New Castle to a farm of 250 acres, situated near 
Lake Mahopac, where, in 1772, he built the first frame house 
which was erected in this part of the country. His house was a 
public inn, where the business of the town was transacted, and 
town meetings were held. He held the office of justice of the 
peace, and was associate judge of the court of common pleas in 
Dutchess County, before the county was divided, and also of 
Putuam County after it was established. The military commis- 
sions are mentioned in his " Fragment of Family History." The 
commission he received from Clinton is now in the posses- 
sion of Benj. T. Crane, his youngest grandson, who owns and 
occupies the old homestead near Mahopac. 

During the Revolution, Gen. Charles Scott, with his staff, made 
his headquarters for a time at John Crane's inn. The troops in 
going to and from the headquarters at Salem, Westchester Co., 
and West Point, on the Hudson, passed that way, and often tar- 
ried over night there. Conspicuous among them was "Capt. 
Poll," a young Irish woman. 

Beside being an unflinching patriot and noted for his integrity 
and superior business capacity in the management of public 
affairs, in his private life Judge Crane was a person of great 
benevolence and kindly feeling; a firm friend and an indulgent 
parent. He was medium-sized, well-proportioned, with mild blue 
eyes and a dignity of manner which commanded the respect of 
all with whom he came in contact. 

In a letter written by a grand-nephew of his, Dr. Geo. B. 
Crane of St. Helena, Cal., who died recently at the advanced age 
of more than ninety years, he said: "Judge Crane came to our 
house, dressed as usual ; silk stockings, and breeches, buckled

above his knees, and ending there ; silver shoe-buckles, and a 
large brimmed fine fur hat. He was a gentleman of the old 
school, and such fashions went out with the old men of his time." 
Judge Crane and his family were all active church workers, 
going on horseback, from their home near Mahopac to the old log 
church, near "Tilly Foster Mines." to attend service, and later, 
aiding in the erection and support of the Gilead Presbyterian 
Church at Carmel. Nor did the good work die with him; he 
left children and grandchildren of unusual attainments, of ster- 
ling worth, and high personal character. His sons Joseph and 
John were very influential men in the Gilead Church, and his 
grandson Azor B. Crane was during his whole life one of the 
most prominent citizens of Putnam County. In 1843, he was 
appointed judge of the court of common pleas, and was the first 
county judge and surrogate elected under the new constitution 
of 1847. Children:

Holmes of Bedford, N. Y., by whom he had six children; mar- 
ried second Mrs. Elizabeth (Wood) Townsend. He was a sol- 
dier in the Revolutionary war. The following story is told of 
him : " After a skirmish with the Indians, the next day he with 
a few picked men were scouting and came upon a lone Indian 
two miles from camp. They took him prisoner, disarmed him, 
and Crane was left to guard him ; but he let the Indian get behind 
him, when the Indian clinched Crane by the hair and tried to cut 
his throat with a knife he had concealed about his person. Crane

took the knife away from the Indian, and when the latter started 
to run away, Crane shot the Indian with his own gun. He 
returned to camp nearly dead from loss of blood, having re- 
ceived a severe gash across his forehead and temples and his 
hand half cut off in getting away the knife." His son Elijah 
gave this account in 1871, bein£ then an old man. He died

home. Here Mr. Noble was born, Oct. 25, 1750, and where 
he identified himself with the church and town affairs. About 
1796 he removed to Skeenesborough, now Whitehall, N. Y., 
where, about two years later, his wife died. Mrs. Noble was a 
woman of rare personal virtues, greatly beloved not only by those

Mr. Noble removed from New Milford. Conn., Dtc. 22, 1799, 
and drove to Essex (then Willsborough). Essex County. N. Y.. 
arriving Jan. 3, 1800, and opened a store on a limited scale. 
But soon became actively engaged in the tanning of leather, 
and subsequently in the manufacture of lumber and later of 
iron, and through his skill and energy accumulated a hand- 
some property. As a member of the State militia and a com- 
missioned officer he was several times mustered into the 
United States service, and took part in the war of 1812 and 
was present at the battle of Plattsburgh. serving as 2d Major 
of the Sih Regiment Detached Militia, 1812; Major Com- 
mandant. 37th Regiment, 1813; Lt.-Col. Commandant, same 
Regiment, 40th Brigade of Infantry (Gen. Daniel Wright). 
Clinton and Essex Counties, N. Y. Militia, 3d Division. Maj- 
Gen. Benjamin Mooers. While serving with the 8th Regiment 
he was stationed, a portion of the time during the year 1812, 
both at Chateuagay and St. Regis, on the Canadian frontier. 
He commanded the Militia in an encounter with the British, 
when they were repulsed, May 13. 1814, at the mouth of the Bo- 
quet River. March 22, 1818, he was commissioned Brigadier- 
General and served until 1821, when he resigned. The business 
capacity displayed by Gen, Noble was quite remarkable. Com- 
ing out from New Milford. Conn., into a new and unreclaimed 
country, with but the trade of a shoemaker upon which to 
rely for the support of his family, and with no powerful con- 
nections, such as favored many of the early settlers of Essex 
County, the outlook at first seemed anything but comforting 
But with the keen perception of a skilful tradesman he saw- 
about him priceless forests of timber, valuable mines of iron, 
nature's storehouse of wealth, if he could but unlock it with 
the keys of skill and personal unremitting industry. This he 
proceeded to do. and through the means of the little store, 
he moved on step by step, enlarging, as he went, until at one 
time he could count a half-score of sawmills located on various 
streams, cutting large quantities of lumber, which he brought 
to Essex to be shipped to the ditt'erent markets. This indus- 
try, together with his tannery and iron business, thrived and 
prospered under his management, showing a business capacity 
of rare quality ; and what brought as much satisfaction to his 
family as all else, and made the home more fascinating and

enjoyable, was the fact that he who had been so bountifully 
rewarded for his wise judgment and faithful application to 
business, was allowed to live to an advanced age, and thereby 
enjoy the fruits of his labors, and see his sons all honorable 
and thorough-going business men, well established on the way 
to success, in following the footsteps of their father. Gen. 
Noble died at the home of his son Harmon, in Essex. June 5, 
1863. His name will ever remain conspicuous among the an- 
nals of the Champlain Valley. He was always interested in 
public matters, although he had little time to give to political 
life ; yet no worthy cause escaped his notice, and he was 
always ready to assist in furthering any good work. He 
was supei visor of the town of Essex 1825-1826. He was a 
liberal subscriber toward the erection of both the Congrega- 
tional and Presbyterian church edifices in Essex, and subse- 
quently united with the latter church. Gen. Noble was a 
master Mason and a member of Essex Lodge, No. 152, F. & 
A. M.. and his first sign-board, now in the possession of his 
grandson Henry Harmon Noble, bears the square and com- 
pass, emblems of the Masonic fraternity. He was a Royal 
Arch Mason, having been exalted March 28, 1811, in Jerusa- 
lem Chapter, No. 2, R. A. M., Vergennes, Vt. Iu politics he 
was a Federalist, later a Whig, and eventually a Republican, 
and a staunch supporter of the Union during the war, as 
were his sons. With a reputation for business honor and 
integrity, which extended throughout the State, he was fit- 
tingly described as the " foremost business man of Northern 
New York." Children by first wife:

Peter and Martha (Frazier) Welch, b. in Vergenues, Vt., Ang. 
31, 1823, where her grandfather Paul Welch, with Abigail 
Crane, his wife, settled in 1808. It was the purpose of Gen. 
Ransom Noble to give each of his children a thorough English 
and business education; and from the easy manner in which 
he managed enterprises of considerable magnitude, -we may 
reasonably infer that he did not fail in this undertaking". 
After Harmon had returned from seeking his education at 
Lansingburgh (N. Y.) Academy, preparatory to assuming a 
business life, he was placed in charge of the store and office 
at Essex, with the books of the tirm his father had estab- 
lished, and which, at this time, was conducting a very large 
business. The young man at once developed an unusual 
capacity for his responsible position, and the prosperity of 
the tirm assumed yet larger proportions than it had previously 
known. The lumbering interest, as well as the tannery and 
iron industries, were conspicuously enlarged under his care- 
ful and wise guidance, while the financial success of the busi- 
ness was of a most flattering nature. Mr. Noble was one of 
those useful persons who could turn his hands to almost any 
kind of an enterprise, and through skill, integrity and close 
application make a success of it. Whatever he undertook 
was carried out with unflinching persistence, while all his 
dealings were conducted on principles of thorough honesty 
and justice. Like his father, he never sought office of any 
kind, outside the State Militia. But in that department he 
was prominent, Governor DeWitt Clinton granting him a 
commission as Major, March 9, 1825, with rank from Dec. 
11, 1824, and serving from time to time on the staff of Geu. 
H. H. Ross. The death of Mr. Noble caused a severe shock 
among those who enjoyed the pleasure of his acquaintance, 
for he was stricken down, amid the scenes of active business 
life. Returning home from his office on the evening of May 
23. 18ii4, after reading his paper he retired for the night. A 
few moments later he uttered his last words to his heart- 
broken wife. The breaking of an abscess in the lungs caused 
his death, which occurred early in the morning of May 24. 
We quote the following from a sketch of Mr. Noble written 
at the time of his death by a person who knew him well ; 

" During his long intercourse with his fellow citizens as 
merchant no man ever had cause to doubt his honor and 
probity. But his worth did not arise merely from his 
capacity as a man of husiness. His kindly disposition, his 
support of the church, his tenderness and kindness as a son. 
parent, husband, relative and friend endeared him to all his 
relatives, and won the esteem of his acquaintances. His 
loss will be deeply felt in the extensive concerns in which he 
was engaged, and by the community generally, and the 
bereavement falls heavily upon his relatives, and doubly so 
on the beloved wife and young children." Children ;

1696, who removed when a young man to New Milford, Litchfield 
County, Conn., and became one of the original proprietors of 
that place. Paul Welch, Esquire, as he was styled, was one of the 
leading men in New Milford, Deputy, Justice of the Peace, 
Lieutenant in the Militia, and it is stated of him in Orcutt's 
"History of New Milford" that "probably there was not 
another man of so much influence in the town when Rev. 
Nathaniel Taylor was settled here as pastor." His epitaph says : 

••In memory of Paul Welch. Esqre., one of the first princi- 
pal settlers of the town, and an original proprietor of the same. 
Departed this life, August 26, 1778", in the 82d year of his age. 

"In his day he served the town in most offices of trust and 
honor, gave good satisfaction, and died possessed of a large 
estate."

married Abigail Crane, and established a home in his native 
town. Here^they remained until the fall of 1808, when they re- 
moved to Vergennes, Vt., whither two of their children had 
already taken up their residence. Mrs. Welch was one of the 
twelve persons who in April, 1810, united with the Congre- 
gational Church of Vergennes ; and at the time of her decease,

Sept. 15, 1815, Mr. Welch died. She died April 6, 1842. It is 
recorded of her (as also of her sister Sarah [Crane] Noble) :

everyone who came in contact with her." Children :

geon 3d regiment, Dutchess County, N. Y., active service* May 
31 to June 1 1 , 1779, June 26 to June 30, 1780, latter time on staff 
of Col. John Field's regiment, Dutchess County Militia. In the 
proceedings of Provincial Congress we find that Sept. 17, 1776, 
ordered that Messrs. Duane, Duer, Schenckand Doctor Crane be a 
committee to inquire into the situation of the Light Horsemen and 
Lieut. Onderdonk and report thereon A portion of the time he 
was stationed on Long Island, where he married Kosanna Cock, 
Aug. 6, 1775. She was born 1756. He married "2d, Feb. 14, 
1798, Aner Leggitt, daughter of Capt. Hackaliah Brown of 
Somers, Winchester County, N. Y., and settled at South East. 
He was Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for Dutchess and 
Putnam Counties. He inherited his father's library, the family 
records and coat of arms. He died Nov. 21, 1825. 

Dr. Joseph Crane, Jr., was Assistant Surgeon militia and ad- 
ditional officer in New York troops. He was Surgeon in 3d 
regt. of Dutchess County, which was in active service May 31 
to June 17, 1779, and June 26 to June 30, 1780, his brother 
Solomon being Adjutant of this regiment at the same time, it 
having been called out on a general alarm to repel the enemy. 
He was a member of the Provincial Congress of the Province of 
New York in 1776, and member of the Assembly 1778, 1779 and 
1796. His home was about two miles east of Brewster, it being 
the place now (1898) owned by Mr. George Sears. There has 
been more or less confusion in reports from various members of 
the family as to honors enjoyed by Joseph Crane, and it has 
been no light task to know just where to place them. It must 
be remembered that there were three Joseph Cranes, father, son 
and grandson. No doubt all three performed well their part 
during the trials connected with the stand for national inde- 
pendence. Joseph, senior, died Aug. 20, 1781 ; so it is fair to 
presume that his son and grandson were most active during the 
war. They were both doctors, which perhaps adds to the con- 
fusion. It would seem that possibly the eldest Dr. Joseph Crane 
would have been the one chosen to attend the Provincial Con- 
gress, he being then fifty-four years of age, while his son Dr. 
Crane, Jr., was but twenty-seven. But as descendants of the 
family place this honor to the young Doctor, there may be no 
good reason for changing it.

of Zebulon. Mrs. Barnes says this Esther Crane married her 
cousin, Samuel Crane, brother of Elijah, and was father to Rev. 
Samuel R. Crane of Milton, Vt.* Rev. Samuel R. Crane was a 
resident of Milton, Vt., perhaps a farmer. In 1833 he became 
a candidate for holy orders, and was ordained deacou by Bishop 
Hopkins, in Burlington, Vt., May 28, 1834. He officiated at first 
in Highgate, Sheldon and Fairfax to 1835 ; ordained priest May 
27, 1835, by Bishop Hopkins at Bellows Falls. From Nov., 
1835, to Nov., 1836, was in charge of the church at Middlebury, 
but was, on account of ill health, obliged to resign, and dis- 
missed to the diocese of Ohio. He is said to have died previous 
to 1840, and buried in the village cemetery at Milton Falls, Vt. 
He went to Vermont from Connecticut, his aged mother with 
him. She was alive Jan. 25, 1829; had shock of paralysis in 
the fall of 1828. Rev. S. R. Crane had a daughter 10 days old 
Jan. 25, 1829. He travelled (so he wrote in" his letter) 1000 
miles to find a good place to remove to from Connecticut. His 
Connecticut friends at that time rather ridiculed Vermont as a 
country to live in; think he went from near New Haven, Conn., 
to Vermont. Children :

R. I. He died in 1872. Silas A. Crane was one of the officiating clergy

there was any relationship between this Silas and Samuel.

Commodore Homicr Crane Blake [5J, was born in Dutchess 
County, N. Y. When about a year old his parents removed 
to Ohio, and settled on what was called the Western Reserve, 
where Homer passed his boyhood days. At the age of 
eighteen he entered the United States Navy as a midship- 
man Date of the appointment being March 2, 1840. He 
was soon assigned to duty on board the Constellation frigate, 
which set sail for a voyage lasting over three years, and en- 
circling the globe. During this trip, while the Constellation 
was anchored off Canton, China, Blake was assigned the 
hazardous task of maintaining communication between the 
vessel and Canton, which he successfully accomplished in an 
open boat with but twelve men, at a time, too, when in China 
an Englishman's head was worth one thousand dollars, and it 
was not an easy matter to distinguish between the head of an 
American and an Englishman. After reaching home in 1844 
and spending a short furlough visiting relatives and friends, 
he was ordered to join the sloop-of-war Preble and served a 
year on the coast of Africa suppressing the slave trade. Re- 
turning to the United States he entered the Naval Academy, 
at Annapolis. From here he graduated in 1846 as passed mid- 
shipman. As war with Mexico seemed inevitable, Blake ap- 
plied for active service and was attached to his old vessel, the 
sloop-of-war Preble, and sent to the coast of California. In 
1848 the Preble was ordered to the East Indies. On reaching 
Canton, China, Blake was so ill as to be unlit for duty, and 
permitted to return home for the purpose of recovering his 
health. For a short period he was engaged on shore in the 
coast survey. In 1850, he again appears bound for the 
Pacific on board the frigate Raritan, but was transferred 
from this vessel lo the sloop-of-war St. Mary's and proceeded 
to the China Seas and home by the Cape of Good Hope, thus 
making in about nine years three voyages around the world. 
In 1856, he again joined the Raritan frigate and repaired to 
the coast of Brazil. Returning to the United States in 1857, 
he was employed for a time on shore, and again sent to the 
coast of Africa to return the following year. With the 
breaking out of our Civil War, Blake applied for active duty, 
for the purpose of defending the flag that had been his pro- 
tection in almost every prominent harbor of the world. 
He was ordered to the Sabine and employed on the coast of 
South Carolina, but when this vessel was assigned to recruit- 
ing duty he asked to be detached from her and given a place 
nearer the post of danger. He was then assigned to com- 
mand the R. R. Cwjler ; soon, however, transferred to the 
command of the Hatteras. She was originally built as a pas- 
senger boat to run between New Orleans aud Galveston, but 
suddenly transformed into a substitute man-of-war by the 
help of a few pine plank to strengthen her decks, that they 
might support the few small guns she was chosen to carry, 
and removing her after cabin. Thus equipped she was of 
suitable strength to perform ordinary blockading duty, to 
which service she was assigned off Galveston, Texas, Com- 
mander Blake having been sent there from New Orleans 
with the Hatteras aud a few other vessels to attempt the re- 
taking of that place, arriving Jan. 10, 1863. 



152 CRASE GENEALOGY. 

About 3 P. M. the following day a strange vessel appeared 
off the port. Supposing it to be a blockade-runner the Hat- 
teras was signaled to give chase, and Commander Blake was 
soon in pursuit. The stranger proved to be no less than the 
Confederate steamer Alabama, Capt. Semmes in command. 
The Hatteras was no even match for the Alabama, not being 
able to hurl in a single broadside one-quarter the weight in 
metal that the latter could, and Blake found himself in a posi- 
tionwhere he must either attempt to run awav or tight. He 
chose the latter, and gave the order to clear the Hatteras for 
action, resolving at the same moment to bring the vessels 
into close quarter, if possible, and attempt to carry his foe 
by boarding. As the Hatteras steamed on for the encounter, 
the Alabama was lying to, broadside on, waiting for the 
struggle soon to come. With the discharge of a broadside 
from the Alabama the battle was begun. Every nerve on 
both vessels was strained to the utmost tensiou. The 
superior speed of the Alabama enabled Semmes to thwart all 
attempts made for boarding by Commodore Blake, although 
the vessels were within thirty yards of each other. For 
twenty minutes the frail Hatteras was exposed to the tre- 
mendous pounding of shot and shell, the latter starting a 
lire, which was raging fiercely and rapidly working towards 
the magazine, which was composed above the water line of 
light pine plank. The men at the magazine remained at 
their post as long as powder could be passed up without ex- 
ploding. The flames had reached the two-inch plank parti- 
tion separating it from the magazine and the vessel was fast 
sinking, but not a man flinched nor left hisgun. The Hatteras 
was so torn and disabled that not one of her guns could now 
be brought to bear on the Alabama, and Blake feeling he had 
no right to sacrifice uselessly the brave men under his com- 
mand, reluctantly gave orders to fire a lee-gun in token of 
surrender. With the aid of the boats from both vessels the 
men of the Hatteras were soon placed on board the Alabama, 
and within ten minutes the Hatteras went to the bottom of 
the ocean with her pennant still flying at the masthead, 
Semmes gaining a fruitless victory. The Alabama was 
severely damaged by the encounter and at once proceeded to 
Kingston, in Jamaica, where she remained thirteen days for 
repairs, which cost eighty-six thousand dollars in gold. 
Commander Blake and his crew in due time reached New 
York via Key West. These men, who fought under Blake, 
held him in such high esteem that they petitioned the Navy 
Department to give their commander the steamer Eutaic. 
and that they might be allowed to join him in a cruise for 
the Alabama, believing they could either sink or capture that 
formidable enemy. The Eutaw was given Blake, but he was 
stationed at the James River, where he rendered valuable 
service. In the latter part of 1803 a desperate movement 
was announced soon to take place on the side of the Con- 
federates. Jan. 24, 18G4, the attempt was made, and had not 
the two rebel rams got aground the result might have been 
much more disastrous, for the Union Naval Commander in- 
stead of protecting his defences from the attack of the Con- 
federate fleet under command of Semmes, who had been 
working down the James River, retired and thus allowed the 
channel to be opened. The night following, at high water, 
the second attempt was to be made. Commander Blake had 
been stationed on the east side, at Deep Bottom, to protect 



SIXTH GENERATION. 153 

the right of the Army of the James. On the morning of 
the twenty-flflh, the commander of the naval division having 
been removed for his conduct the previous day, Blake was 
placed in command of the ironclad fleet, torpedo and picket 
boats. On going on board the Onondaga he found her port 
propeller disabled; yet, with her in this condition and only a 
few small gunboats, he was able to contend with the Con- 
federate fleet and caused it to retreat back to Richmond. 
A false step or a moment's hesitation at that time would have 
endangered the safety of the Union armies. Against the 
advice of nearly all the officers, he got the Onondaga, with 
the assistance of tugs, close to the obstructions, and direct- 
ly under the tire of the Confederate batteries, and in such a 
position that if she was sunk, either by the rams or torpedo 
boats, as he expected, she would take the place of the re- 
moved obstructions. This action prevented a second at- 
tempt, as he was afterward informed by one of the oflicers 
who was then attached to the Confederate fleet. Admiral 
Porter wrote Blake, " Had your predecessor done as well, 
we should now be in possession of the entire rebel navy and 
on our way to Richmond." 

Blake was coutinued in command of the ironclads and 
naval picket line, and took part in the engagement which 
caused the fall of Richmond. In 1867 he was head of the 
Bureau of Navigation, at Portsmouth. N. H. But the order 
soon came to proceed again to the Chinese waters. This 
time under the fighting Admiral John Rogers. Capt. Blake 
was sent up the Han River, in Korea, in command of an ex- 
pedition to punish the Koreans for a treacherous attack 
upon an American force sent to inquire into the loss of the 
crew of the schooner General Sherman in August, 1800, and 
to arrange for a treaty between the United States and Korea. 
Although this sudden attack was planned by the Koreans with 
the iuteniion of annihilating the Americans, it resulted in 
comparatively little damage. Admiral Rogers gave them ten 
clays in which to make an apology. None came, and the expedi- 
tion, with 759 men in all, under Capt. Blake, was dispatched 
to punish the treacherous Koreans. June 10, 1(568, the men 
landed and with the help of the gunboats Monocacy and Col- 
orado captured the first fort. The following day the men pro- 
ceeded on up the heights capturing the second line of fortili- 
cations. But the third and main fortification, located on a 
high rocky hill, garrisoned by a vastly superior force in num- 
bers, was yet to be taken. It was a severe and hazardous 
undertaking. Many of the Americans were overcome with 
heat. But the word was given, and up our men climbed the 
steep hill in the face of deadly missiles, and made a desperate 
hand-to-band encounter, with this result : about 350 Koreans 
were killed and 20 taken prisoners. The Americans had 
three men killed and ten wounded. Five forts, with fifty 
flags, and a considerable number of large and small guns 
were captured during the two days. 

His extended service along the coast of China and ex- 
posure to the malaria of that region completely shattered 
his constitution, and for some years after his return home 
he suffered severely in bodily health. He died at his home 
in New York City, Jan. 27, 1.880, at the age of 5fi years, just 
after receiving his well-earned commission as Commodore 
in the United States Navy. He was a warm-hearted, cour- 
teous, considerate, Christiau gentleman. When he was on

his way to Galveston, Texas, just prior to the engagement 
with the Alabama, in a private letter, written to a friend, he 
said : " I have much to live for, but I could not be happy to 
purchase my life with any neglect of the duty I owe to my 
country. I shall not seek danger ; but if it comes I shall take 
it in the line of my duty, and endeavor to do credit to myself, 
family and State." Several officers of the United States 
Navy, who have rendered signal service to their country 
during the late war with Spain, served under Blake in that 
memorable Korean expedition. Among them, Commodores 
J. C. Watson, W. S. Schley, Rear- Admiral L. A. Kimberly, 
Captain C. M. Chester, and Commander Albion V. Wadhams, 
all of whom speak in the highest terms that he was an officer 
of great ability, ceaseless energy, indomitable courage and 
an excellent seaman. 

He married Mary, daughter of Judge James Flanagan.

Young, of blessed memory, and soon after joined the Methodist 
Episcopal Church, in which communion he remained until his 
death. He held the office of Class Leader from the period of 
his first introduction into the Church until his infirmities pre- 
vented him from farther engaging in the active duties of the 
position. He also acted as Superintendent of the Sabbath 
School for a great portion of the time ; and all that appertained 
to his official position was always well and faithfully done. In 
all the relations of life, Mr. Crane was ever respected and 
esteemed. As a neighbor he was kind and obliging; as a friend 
true as the needle to the pole; as a citizen loval and patriotic. 
But it was in his own family and in the Church of Christ 
where his many excellent qualities shone forth most conspicu- 
ously. To the loving, devoted husband and the watchful ami 
affectionate father, he joined the character of the humble, self- 
denying, earnest, working Christian. To toil in the vineyard of 
his Master was to him a labor of love. In this regard he seemed 
to count all else but loss so that ' he might attain unto the excel- 
lency of the knowledge which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' 
Brother Crane not only adorned his profession in the way we have 
just indicated, but he was likewise equally ready to contribute of 
his money, generously too, to support the good cause he loved so 
well. His house was always open, and no man ever came to it 
hungry, but that he fed him ; thirsty, but that he gave him drink ; 
naked, and he clothed him ; sick, and he ministered unto him. 
Thus in his charities he seemed to be actuated by the principle, 
that ' inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, 
my brethren, ye have done it unto me.' Mr. Crane, too, was a 
man of more than ordinary intellect, well posted on all the prom- 
inent topics of the day, and his opinions in relation to them 
were always characterized with intelligence and good sense. He 
was likewise one of the most genial and pleasant companions with 
whom to converse that can be found in any community, and this 
particular element in his constitutional make-up caused his society 
to be eagerly sought both by young and old. Mr. Crane was 
also a very successful farmer and left a fine estate to be inherited 
by his widow and children. One other thing we must not forget 
to mention, and that is the fortitude, resignation and cheerful- 
ness, which he exhibited all through his protracted and painful 
illness. No words of complaint or murmuring ever escaped 
him. In fact, he would not unfrequently raise the spirits of his 
own family and friends by perpetrating some little pleasantry, or 
by throwing into the conversation a spicy remark, which would 
serve to drive away all gloom and melancholy. Indeed, it is our 
opinion that this cheerfulness and the stir and ambition with 
which he was naturally endowed, added months if not vears to 
his life."

Hezekiah. 4 John. 3 Jonathan, 2 Benjamin 1 ), married Oct. 16, 
1838, at Easton, Pa., Mary Elizabeth Howell. She was born 
there Sept. 18, 1820, and there they established their home. She 
died May 20. 1845. He was born at East Windsor, Hartford 
County, Conn., on an old manor that had been handed down 
from father to son for generations before the Revolution. In 
that dark and desperate struggle his grandfather, David Crane, 
did good service under the immediate command of Gen. 
Washington. 

The home training of young Crane was in the strict Puritan 
style. His school days did not differ materially from those of 
other boys similarly situated : attended the common school, where 
he paid his own way. Receiving a certificate of qualification 
to teach the common English branches, he soon began teaching 
in Vernon, Conn. ; in a short time however he accepted an 
invitation from his uncle, Dr. John W. Crane, a practicing physi- 
cian of Hartford, to commence the study of medicine and dental 
surgery in his office. After thoroughly preparing himself, he 
opened an office in Easton. Pa., where he conducted a successful 
business for 22 years. 

In October, 1854, he emigrated to Kansas, and settled on the 
present site of Topeka. As a member of the town company he 
took an active part in everything that pertained to the upbuilding 
of the city. Town lots were donated to all who would erect 
houses and live on the town site, and also to churches and socie- 
ties of all kinds that were ready to take advantage of the generous 
offer. Dr. Crane was appointed to the difficult task of making 
selections for incomers, societies and churches. Many persons 
are still living in Topeka who remember with what zeal he pointed 
out the advantages of this or that particular locality. His lan- 
guage on such occasions proved prophetic in many instances. 

He was active in the formation of the Kansas Free State party. 
In 1857 the St. Joseph & Topeka Railroad Company was 
organized, and he was chosen treasurer. Little actual work was 
ever done on this route, although he expended much time and 
money in making it a living institution by securing the payment 
of 10 per cent, of capital stock. This planning and managing

finally resulted in the construction of the Atchison, Topeka ii 
Santa Fe Railroad. 

In 1859, there being no permanent place in Topeka for the 
interment of the dead, and having failed in several efforts to 
organize a cemetery company, Dr. Crane made the venture at his 
own expense, and laid out, in a very tasty and artistic manner, a 
large plot of ground about a mile east of the city. For this act 
of generosity, if for nothing else, he will ever be remembered 
kindly by the citizens of Topeka. In the same year he became 
mayor of the city, on the death of the mayor-elect, by virtue of 
his office of president of the city council. This was just at the 
time when the permanent location of the State capital by a direct 
vote of the people was being agitated. Mainly through the wish 
and prompt action of the acting mayor and city council Topeka 
was made the permanent seat of government at that election. The 
first bridge over the Kansas River was built in 1857-8, largely 
through his influence and exertions. This bridge was swept away 
by a freshet .July 19, 1858, and was replaced by a temporary 
pontoon, that served the purpose until the present iron structure 
was erected by Mortimer Cook. Dr. Crane and others. 

On the breaking out of the rebellion he and two of his sons 
enlisted for the war. His knowledge of medicine, kindness of 
heart and generosity peculiarly fitted him to take care of the sick, 
and he was made a hospital steward, and on several occasions 
established and conducted general hospitals by order of the medi- 
cal directory. This branch of service was in accord with his 
sympathetic nature, and he was enabled to make it a perfect 
success. 

On his return from the camp he was chosen president of the 
board of education. Under his administration several large 
school-houses were erected, among them the Lincoln School 
building. He has ever been liberal and foremost in advocating 
the interests of education, assisting all societies and efforts in 
every move to harmonize and liberalize society. From the rigid 
church discipline under which he was reared he gradually became 
more liberal in his views, until he found himself a willing and 
confirmed disciple of ancient and modern Spiritualism, and in all 
his relations with his fellows he carried into his daily practice the 
firm belief that there is ever by his side an immortal spirit that 
is cognizant of his every act, whether good or evil ; one that 
mourns over his wrong doings and rejoices in every good deed, 
and under certain conditions is able, as in the old biblical times, 
to make its presence manifest by words and signs, and to give 
admonition of coming events.* He died Nov. I'l. 18*4, at the 
home of his eldest son in Carthage. New Mexico, whither he had 
gone for a visit. Funeral services were at Topeka, Kan. Chil

arranged. 

[See opposite page, No. 2746.] 

Carso Crane 8 married Electa L. Glidden. He served in 
the late war. Enlisted as a private from Jones County, Iowa, 
in July, 1861, elected 2d Lieutenant, ordered into camp at 
Dubuque, and mustered into the United States service Sept. 
2, in Co. D, 9th Regt. Iowa Infantry. Then proceeded via. 
St. Louis, Mo., to Pacific City, and with Gen. Curtis in com- 
mand, the army of the South West started after the enemy under 
General Price, came up with the rear of the enemy before reach- 
ing Springfield, but could not bring on an engagement until Price 
had formed a junction with Van Dorn, when with a force of 
35,000 they turned upon Curtis with his 10,000 men. In a 
skirmish at Nubben Ridge the casualties were light, but at Pea 
Ridge, where they fought March 6 and 7, 1861, the company of 
which he was then in command went into the engagement with 
55 men, had 2 killed. 2 taken prisoners, and 29 wounded. Com- 
pany C. having lost its officers, was attached to Mr. Crane's 
company on the afternoon of the 6th, and continued there 
throughout that action. Afterwards they marched through 
Arkansas to Helena, in August; remained there until December; 
made an attack on Chickasaw Bayou and were repulsed ; returned 
to Arkansas and captured Arkansas Post; returned to Vicksburg 
and worked in the famous cut-off canal. Here Mr. Crane be- 
came prostrated by the effects of a sunstroke in connection with 
chronic diarrhoea and resigned in March, 1863, on a surgeon's 
certificate. He was made 1st Lieutenant in September, 1862, 
and Captain in February, 1863. While in camp at Helena, he 
served several months on the staff of Gen. Vandevers. Now 
(1899) resides in Anamosa, Iowa. Children:

••Dr. George Belden Crane was born July 31, 1806, in the 
State of New York, Dutchess County, now Putnam, and died 
Monday, May 9, 1898. His first school-days were spent in a 
little shanty near his father's sawmill on the Croton river. Like 
other boys in those days, he worked on the farm in the summer 
and went to school in the winter. When sixteen years old he 
secured a certificate and commenced teaching school, receiving 
therefor about §12 per month and board. Four years later he 
entered the medical department of the State University in New 
York City, graduating in 1832. He soon turned his face west- 
ward, travelling from Albany to Schenectady on the first passen- 
ger railroad in the United States. He continued his journev on

a canal-boat to Buffalo, and by steamer from there to Cleveland. 
Obio, thence to the Great Scioto river. Here he settled and 
practiced medicine for nearly five years, marrying, meantime, 
Maria, eldest daughter of Dan Young, a pioneer from New 
Hampshire. The health of his wife demanding a change of 
climate, he in 1836 removed to Northern Alabama, where he 
continued the practice of his profession until he found his consti- 
tution was beina: undermined by hard labor in what was then not 
only a hot but a malarious section. From here he went to Pike 
county, Missouri, a place made conspicuous by California emi- 
gration. It was here that in 1343 he had, unsolicited, the honor 
of being one of two or three physicians of that State on whom 
the medical department of the University of Missouri conferred the 
honorary degree of M. D. In January, 1853, Dr. Crane, with 
family, started by sailing vessel for California via the Horn. On 
the 3rd of May. 1853. he left San Francisco by steamer for Alviso. 
aud thence to San Jose by stage. Here he lived and prospered for 
four- years, when the continued ill health of his wife, caused him 
to relinquish charge of the city and county hospital and a large 
private practice and remove to Napa. Having studied viticulture 
as followed in France and Germany, and comparing the soil of 
this valley with that of other countries, he decided to engage in 
that industry and at once purchased nearly 400 acres of land 
near the little hamlet of St. Helena, paying therefor an average 
of between §6 and -S7 per acre. He procured Mission cuttings 
from San Jose, there being no foreign ones in the country, and 
planted about twelve acres in February, 1859, a portion of which 
grew well. The planting was continued, and in ten years he 
possessed a vineyard of one hundred acres. He encountered all 
the vicissitudes usual to pioneers in any movement, but ultimately 
achieved success. It was not long after his acres of wilderness 
had been converted into a fruitful and beautiful home that his 
first wife died, and in 187i> he married the widow of A.J. Gray- 
son, the ornithologist who lost his life while painting the ornith- 
ology of Central America. The doctor saw the little hamlet of 
redwood shanties near his home grow to a substantial and thrifty 
town with comfortable homes established so close together that 
stations along the line of railroad had to be placed a mile or two 
apart for the convenience of residents. For many years deceased 
lived quietly, always extending a hearty welcome to the visitor 
who crossed the threshold of his hospitable home. He passed 
considerable time in reading and writing. His articles for the 
press were many, and he was always pleased when new thoughts 
were brought out. In 1885. when 79 years old. he wrote his life 
history, together with incidents, experiences and comments on a 
variety of topics. This he caused to be published for distribution 
among his relatives and friends. And now that its author has 
gone, we quote from its pages a few of his thoughts on death : 
•But whv regard the dav of death as an "evil dav"? It is an

event as natural as that of our birth. Our birth was for a pur- 
pose. We are compelled to believe, from an analogical reason- 
ing, that there is a purpose in so called death. The apparent 
difference between birth and death is not real. The first is to 
people earth with rudimental intelligences, the next to translate 
those intelligences to a higher sphere of existence. Progress is 
the rule of nature.' What better can be said of him than that 
the ninety-two years of his earthly existence were spent in well- 
directed efforts for the benefit of mankind ! He possessed a 
noble character, was a kind friend and a good citizen.

Judge Addison Moses Crane was born in Litchfield, Herki- 
mer County, N. Y., July 2, 1814. He served at Buffalo, N. 
Y., in the Navy Island rebellion during the months of June 
and September, 1838. He married in Catskill, Greene County, 
Oct. 21, 1839, Gertrude Ashley, who was born at Catskill, June 
20, 1820. They settled at Nunda, Livingston County, where 
their two eldest children were born. About 1844 he removed to 
La Fayette, Ind., where he served as judge from 1848 to 1852. 
In 1853 he removed to California, making the trip around Cape 
Horn, and settled in Alameda County. Here he purchased twelve 
acres of land, extending from Buena Vista avenue back to the 
Canal and from Oak to Walnut streets, in Oakland, where he lived. 
He was the first judge for Alameda County, 1853 to 1857, and 
represented Alameda County in the State Senate, 1862 and 1863, 
and was also a railroad commissioner. His death occurred Oct. 
20, 1887, and the following memorial so plainly shows with what 
high esteem he was held by those who knew him best, that we 
cannot refrain from printing it in full : 

" In Memoriam.

JOHN CRANE, OF COVENTRY, CONNECTICUT, 
AND HIS DESCENDANTS. 



Mr. William L. Weaver, then editor of the Willimanttc 
Journal, began Oct. 10, 1862, to publish in that paper data 
relating to the history of Windham County, Conn., and gave 
considerable attention to genealogies of the families that were 
early settlers there. Among them were some of the descend- 
ants of Jonathan Crane, of Windham, and John Crane, of 
Coveutry. For reasons best known to himself, the publication of 
the history was abandoned, although the publication of the geneal- 
ogies was continued in the Journal for some time : and the 
following is copied from that paper, issued under date of Oct. 20, 
1864, and from the pen of Mr. Weaver: — 

"•John Crane, an early settler of Coventry, was the common 
ancestor of the Mansfield Cranes. We have made considerable 
effort to trace his ancestry, and to connect him with some of the 
early Crane families in New England ; but without success. He 
was certainly one of the very early settlers of Coventry, where 
he was living in 1708, where he had land deeded to him. He was 
not a descendant from Jonathan, of Windham, and we cannot 
find that he was the son of either of the brothers of Jonathan, of 
Wethersfield ; but we strongly suspect there was a connection 
between the families. The fact that John Crane, of Windham, 
settled in Coventry while John Crane, the Coventry settler, was 
living there ; the similar family names and traditions among some 
branches of the Cranes, lend color to the suspicion. The early 
settlers of Coventry were mostly from the towns of the Connecti- 
cut River valley, including some families from Wethersfield; and 
we consider it not at all impossible that John Crane, the Coventry 
settler, was a son of the Wethersfield Cranes, though no record 
of his birth has been found there. John Crane was one of the 
accepted inhabitants of Coventry in 1730, when the first list of 
17 



242 CRANE GENEALOGY. 

freemen was made ; and, of course, a resident of the town at that 
time. He subsequently removed to Mansfield, but at what time 
is not ascertained. It is supposed that he lived near the 
Willimautic River, and that his removal to Mansfield was only 
across the stream, the dividing line between the towns. Descend- 
ants say he was buried in the Willimantic burying-grouud above 
Eagleville, in Mansfield. We have not ascertained in regard to 
the church relations of John Crane ; but from what we have been 
able to gather, judge that both he and his wife were pious and 
respectable people in comfortable circumstances. He is called 
Mr. in the Mansfield records, — then a special mark of respect. 

John Crane's will names his " wife Abigail ; children, Hezekiah, 
Ebenezer, John ; three grandchildren of my daughter Abigail 
Barrows ; daughter Mary Allen, wife of Samuel ; and children 
of my daughter Ruth Paddock, deceased." Mrs. Crane also 
names the same children in her will. After careful investigation, 
with records of the various lines in view, the suspicion still 
remains, with accumulated strength, even bordering on belief, 
that John Crane, of Coventry, was a descendant of Benjamin, 
senior, of Wethersfield. From the birth of this John, of Coventry, 
in 1689 or 1690, to his death, in 1765, there were no less than 
seven John Cranes living within a radius of twenty-five or thirty 
miles from Wethersfield : John, son of Benjamin, b. 1663 ; John, 
son of Jonathan, b. 1687; John, son of Abraham, b. 1700; 
John, son of John of Jonathan, b. 1709 ; John, son of John of 
Coventry, b. 1716; John, son of John of Abraham, b. 1739; 
and John, son of John, of Coventry, b. 1743. It is, there- 
fore, apparent that John was a popular name with the Crane 
family at that time, and great care has been exercised in 
arranging their children in their proper lines. 

The question arises : If this John was grandson of Benjamin, 
senior, of Wethersfield, whose son was he? Most likely he was 
son of John, who went among the first settlers to Windham with 
his brother Jonathan. He is reported as having been by trade 
a blacksmith, and the record fixes his death Oct. 21, 1694, at the 
age of 31 years. He married Abigail Butler, by whom he had 
one child, Josiah. b. March 22, 1694. This marriage with 
Abigail Butler took place Oct. 27, 1692, he being then twenty-nine 
years and six months old. With the laws of the colony encour- 
aging, and almost compelling, early marriages, it is not unlikely 
that this was his second marriage, and that, while in Windham. 



DESCENDANTS OP JOHN CRANE. 243 

by a former wife, who had died, he had a son .John. If not why 
did he not fotlow the custom and name Abigail's child John? Of 
course, this is theory; no records have been found to confirm 
beyond doubt the position here taken. He may have been the 
son of Jacob, but that is rather doubtful. 

John Crane, supposed to be this ancestor of the Mansfield 
Cranes, purchased land of Samuel Burnham, of Windsor Conn 
in 1708, which he sold in 1711 to Benjamin Jones. He then 
purchased home lot No. 68. 

Rev. Jonathan Crane, for forty years a minister at Middletown, 
N. T., who gave much time to investigating the history of his 
immediate family, entertained the same opinion, that this John, of 
Coventry, was grandson of Benjamin, of Wethersfield.

field, Conn., but was of Lebanon in 1765, when in April of that 
year he declined to act with his brother Hezekiah as one of the 
executors of his father's will. He could not have long been a 
resident of Lebanon, for he was of Mansfield in 1762 and again 
in 1770. It is supposed the family removed from the town, as 
no records of his descendants are to be found at Mansfield 
where his children were born. It appears that he was twice 
married, for his grandson Edmund Franklin Craine, says he 
married a Welsh lady by name of Mary Neff . Children :

Crane lived and died in Mansfield, Conn. ; he was executor of

their last days with him. Children:

JASPER CRANE OF NEW HAVEN, CONN., ALSO, 
NEWARK, N. J., AND HIS DESCENDANTS. 



FIRST GENERATION. 



1. Jasper Crane 1 was one of the original settlers of the New 
Haven Colony, June 4, 1639, and signed the first agreement at a 
general meeting of all the free planters held in Mr. Newman's 
barn. He took the oath of fidelity at the organization of the 
government, with Campfield, Pennington, Gov. Eaton and others. 
In 1 644 he was "freed from watching and trayning in his own 
person because of his weakness, but to find one for his turn." 
Was a member (with Treat) of the General Court, and many 
years a magistrate. Was interested in a bog-ore furnace at East 
Haven in 1651. He removed to Branford in 1652. He was 
elected a magistrate in 1658, and held the office of deputy for 
some years previous to that date. 

In a note-book kept by Thomas Lechford, Esq., a lawyer in 
Boston, Massachusetts Bay, from June 27, 1638, to July 29, 
1641, we find the following: "Samuel Searle of Quinapease 
Planter in behalfe of Jasper Crane of the same Agent or Attorney 
for Mr. Roe Citizen of London Demiseth unto" Henry Dawson 
and John Search of the Same one house and house lottTand three 
acres of land lying in Boston wherein William Herricke now 
dwelleth from 29 Sept. next for five years four pounds ten 
shillings rent half yearly, to fence to the value four pounds ten 
shillings, to repaire 21-6-1640." 

This transaction, showing his connection with a gentleman of 
London, England, would lead one to think that he certainly was 
known there, and might have lived there. Whether or not the 
above record furnished the foundation for the tradition that he 
came from London to America, we do not know. But such a 
tradition has been cherished by some of his descendants. Ex- 
tensive research among the record offices in London has thus far 
failed however of finding any trace of him there. It is also said 
that he came over from England with Winthrop in the ship 
Arbella. 

But the date of Jasper Crane's birth, or the place in which he 
was born, have not been fixed. Whether he came from parents 
occupying high or middle stations in life can as yet only be 
determined by the records revealed to us. He assuredly was one 
of the staunch and active men among the first settlers of the 
New Haven Colony as well as one of the fathers of the new 
settlement in New Jersey. He, with Capt. Robert Treat, seemed 
to have a large share of the weight of responsibility of that young 
colony upon their shoulders, and its success at heart. Mr. 



296 CKANE GENEALOGY. 

Crane did not go, it is said, with the first company to " Milford," 
as the first settlement at Newark, N. J., was called, but signed, 
with twenty-two others, the first contract in 1665. Jan. 20, 
1667, he headed the list of signers and church members of the 
first Church at Newark, and became one of the most influential 
and active men of the new colony. Jasper Crane and Robert 
Treat were the first magistrates in Newark. It is said that Mr. 
Crane was dissatisfied at the New Haven Colony becoming united 
with the Connecticut Colony ; he preferred to have the New Haven 
Colony remain separate. 

He was a surveyor and merchant, as well as a magistrate, and 
with Mr. Myles laid out the most of the New Haven town plot, 
located grants, established division lines, and settled disputed 
titles. It is said that he was steward of Rev. John Davenport's 
property in 1639. In March, 1641, he received a grant of 100 
acres of land in the East Meadow. He was one of the New 
Haven Company concerned in the settlement on the Delaware 
River in 1642, who were so roughly handled by the Dutch. In 
1643 his estate was voted at £480, with three persons in his 
family, — self, wife and son John. In 1644—45 he received a 
grant of 16 acres of upland, situated in East Haven, upon which he 
built a house, in which his son Joseph was born. While residing 
at this place he was in trade as a merchant, but not being satisfied 
with the location he sold this place Sept. 7, 1652, and became 
one of the first planters of Branford, Conn., a new settlement 
then just being instituted by families from Wethersfield, Conn., 
under the leadership of Mr. Swayne, and a few from Southamp- 
ton, L. I. 

Jasper Crane, Esq., and Mr. Wm. Swayne were the first depu- 
ties to the General Court of Electors from Branford in May, 
1653, Mr. Crane being returned during the four succeeding years. 
In May, 1658, he was chosen one of four magistrates for the New 
Haven Colony and held the office by appointment until 1663; 
also one of the magistrates called together by the Governor, at 
Hartford, in 1665-67. In the union of the Colonies he- was 
chosen one of the assistants, was also Trustee of County Court, 
New Haven, 1644. His house lot in New Haven was located on 
what is now Elm Street, at the corner of Orange Street, the same 
now occupied by the Church of St. Thomas. 

The first Church of Newark was founded in 1667, and a build- 
ing erected, about 1714 or 1716, a second meeting-house was 
built, and the third erected about 1787 to 1791. The people of 
Orange, Bloomfield and Montclair communed with the Newark 
Church until about 1716. In fact, for considerably more than a 
hundred years after the founding of Newark the crest of the first 
mountain was the western boundary of the town, and until the 
year 1806 the town of Newark was divided into three wards : 
Newark Ward, Orange Ward, and Bloomfield Ward. That year 
Orange became a separate town, and six years later Bloomfield 
Ward became the town of Bloomfield. This part of Newark took

in the territory from the Passaic on the east to the crest of the 
first mountain on the west, and as this section was so thoroughly 
occupied by the descendants of Jasper Crane it was early called 
Lranetown.

BeUevme 1118 ' " UBmeDSe estate near Newark, now known "as 
The exact date that Jasper senior took his leave of Branford 
has not been definitely fixed. In the spring of 1666 the people 
of Branford, becoming dissatisfied about the union of the New 
Haven and Connecticut Colonies, and particularly on account of 
granting the right of suffrage to the inhabitants not members of 
the hurch, resolved at once to remove to New Jersey, as a-ents 
who had been sent thither, came back bringing favorable reports 
of the new country. In October, after adopting a code of laws 
for their government, Mr. Pierson with a portion of his congre- 
gation left Branford for their future home, Newark N°J 
Jasper senior although one of the original twenty-three who 
signed the first contract in 1665, still was active in public affairs 
in Branford, holding the office of assistant magistrate in 1666 
and 166/. But Jan. 30, 1667, he headed the list of signers to a 
new covenant and disposing of his property at Branford that 
year took up his permanent home at Newark and became very 
prominent in all transactions of the town, especially during the 
hrst fourteen years of its growth and development. " He was the 
first president of the town court, and first on the list of deputies 
to the General Assembly of New Jersey for several years \t 
the drawing of Home Lots, Feb. 6, 1667, Lot 49 fell to the senior 
Jasper Crane, No. 40 to Deliverance Crane, and No. 62 to John 
Crane, they being his two eldest sons. 

At a town meeting of Newark, held January, 1668, Jasper 
Crane, with Robert Treat, were chosen magistrates for the year 
ensuing, and also deputies or burgesses for the General Assembly 
for the same year. This Robert Treat was the first recorder 
or town clerk for Newark, and was exceedingly prominent in all 
public matters while he remained in the settlement. But in 1671 
he returned to Connecticut, where he was held in high esteem 
and for several years was Governor of that Colony." proving a 
faithful and conscientious worker for the interest of the inhabit- 
ants under his charge. From January, 1668, until his death, 
Jasper Crane senior was given a prominent part to perform in 
the settlement of Newark. May 20, 1668, he as one of a com- 
mittee signed an agreement fixing the dividing line between 
Newark Town and Elizabeth Town. July 28, 1669, he with 
Robert Treat was chosen by the town to take first opportunity 
'■ to go to ' York' to advise with Col. Lovelace concerning our 
standing. Whether we are designed to be a part of the Duke's 
Colony or not, and about the Neck, and liberty of purchasing 
lands up the river, that the Town would petition for." Re-elected 
magistrate January, 1669, " and Deputy to the General Assembly 



298 CRANE GENEALOGY. 

if there shall be any." He with Robert Treat were chosen to 
be moderators of town meetings for the year ensuing. Jan. 2. 
1670, again chosen magistrate and deputy, serving in latter 
capacity annually until 1674. and at the town meeting Feb. 20, 
it was voted that the governor be requested to confirm Jasper 
Crane and Robert Treat magistrates or justices of the peace. 
The same honors were conferred in 1671, and in addition it was 
voted Jan. 22. 1671, that "every man should bring his half 
bushel to Henry Lyon & Joseph VV r aters and have it tried and 
sealed when made fit with Mr. Crane's, which for the present is 
the standard." Mr. Crane was also one of a committee to see to 
burning the woods for a year. May 13. 1672. Mr. Crane and 
Lieut. Swain were chosen representatives for the town to consult 
with other representatives of the country to order matters for the 
safety for the country. June 17, 1672. Mr. Crane was again 
chosen magistrate, and also chosen •• President of the Quarterly 
Court to be held in Newark to begin September nest." He was 
also given '• liberty to sell liquors in the town till the country 
order alter it." 

At a town meeting July 1, 1673, Mr. Crane was chosen to 
serve on a committee, with Mr. Bond. Mr. Swain, Mr. Kitchell 
and Mr. Lyon, to consider with messengers from other towns 
about sending a petition to the Lords Proprietors in England for 
the removal of grievances ; and July oth the town agreed to pay 
for sending the messenger to England, as the above committee 
had agreed with Mr. Delevall about money to cover that expense. 

August 4th the town chose Mr. Crane. Mr. Bond. Lieut. Swain 
and Sergeant John Ward deputies to treat with the generals 
about having a privileged county between the two rivers Passaic 
and Araritine. August 12th again chosen magistrate ; September 
6th. on committee to try and secure the "Neck" to add to the 
possessions of Newark; and September 16th instructed by the 
town to " treat with the generals, and, if they can. to buy 
it." It would seem the committee were successful, for Octo- 
ber 25th Mr. Crane, Mr. Molyns and Mr. Hopkins were 
chosen to look after the confirmation of the purchase of 
the Neck and sue for further easement in respect to pay. 
November 17th Capt. Swain and Mr. Crane were chosen to 
continue the trade for the Neck. The following year (June 
29, 1674.) the town voted to have Mr. Crane and Mr. Pierson. 
Jr., carry the petition and present it to the Governor and 
Council at North Orange to "obtain confirmation of their 
bought and paid for lands." August 10, 1674, was again 
chosen magistrate. Mr. Crane was now becoming quite ad- 
vanced in years, and the important and exacting services 
required of him by the town must have proved a heavy tax upon 
his strength, for he now dropped out of political office, while his 
sous. John. Azariah and Jasper. Jr.. began to work in. Feb. 19, 
1673-9. it having been discovered that many of the settlers had 
taken up lands contrary to a town agreement, Mr. Crane stated 



FIKST GENERATION. 299 

at town meeting that he would lay down all lands so taken if 
others would, and March 10th following he was chosen, with 
Robert Dalglesh and Jasper Crane, Jr., to lay out Samuel 
Potter's lot again. This entry, so far as the public records of 
Newark shows, closes the public life of the senior Jasper Crane. 

If we may judge from the entries upon the Newark Town 
Records we should say that, next to Robert Treat, Jasper Crane 
was the most prominent figure in the early settlement of that 
town. After Treat returned to Connecticut, Jasper Crane's 
name came first in the filling by popular vote the highest and 
most responsible positions of public trust in the settlement. That 
he held the confidence of the people is clearly manifested by their 
returning him annually for so many years, and until the infirmi- 
ties of age unfitted him for further public service. But the 
family name and traits of character were appreciated, for no 
sooner than the name of Jasper senior disappears from the pro- 
ceedings of the town meetings than the names of John, Azariah 
and Jasper, Jr., are brought into recognition. The patents for 
land in Newark to Jasper Crane, Aug. 25, 1675, covering one 
hundred and sixty-eight acres, are as follows : " House: lot 14 
acres, 17 a. his first division on Great Neck, 11 a. in part for his 
second division ou said Neck, 6 a. on said Neck, 4 a. at bottom 
of the Neck, 20 a. for his second division by Two Mile Brook, 26 
a. his third division by head of Mile Brook, 20 a. for his third 
division at the head of the branch of Second River, 14 a. of 
meadow for his first division at Great Island, 12 a. of meadow 
for his second division by the Great Pond, 14 a. for proportion of 
bogs, 5 a. of meadow near the Great Island, 1 a. of meadow 
at Beef Point, 4 a. of meadow near Wheeler's Point, yealcling i 
penny lawful money of England, or in such pay as the country 
doth produce at merchants' price, for every one of the said acres, 
the first payment to begin the 25th of March, which was in the 
year 1670." These lands were taken up and occupied some time 
prior to date of the patents. Another warrant seems to have 
been issued to Jasper Crane, May 1, 1675, for 103 acres of land 
in Newark. 

At a town meeting held Aug. 24, 1670, an agreement was made 
with Mr. Robert Treat and Sergt. Richard Harrison to build and 
maintain a sufficient corn-mill upon the brook called Miil Brook. 
They were given sole privilege of this brook, with all the town 
grists, and all stone within the town limits suitable for mill- 
stones, with all the timber that was prepared by Joseph Horton 
for the mill, and two days' work of every man and woman that 
holds an allotment in the town, with all the lands formerly 
granted to Joseph Horton. They were to hold this land as their 
own so long as they held and maintained the mill, and not to 
dispose of the mill without consent of the town. The town was 
also to give thirty pounds in good wheat, pork, beef, or one- 
fourth in good Indian corn, at such prices as would enable them 
to exchange it for or procure iron, millstones, or the work- 



300 CRANE GENEALOGY. 

man's wages, &c. : Winter wheat 5 shillings per bushel ; summer 
wheat 4s. 5d. ; pork 3d. per lb. ; beef 2d. ; Indian corn 2s. 6d. 
per bushel. As Mr. Treat was to return to Connecticut, Jasper 
Crane assumed his portion of the contract. 

From Jasper Crane we have a large number of descendants — 
one branch of them located westward of Newark, and five or six 
miles distant, calling the place Cranetown. Some of his descend- 
ants located four miles southward of Newark, at a place called 
Elizabeth Town. Among those who settled here was Stephen 
Crane, who there is good reason to believe was an elder son of 
Jasper, born in England about 1630. 

From these points members of the family pressed their way 
further westward, crossing the Passaic River, settling Morris 
County. They were all remarkable for frugality, honesty and 
piety, and were mostly Presbyterians. It has heen said by one, 
not a member of the family, " no more respectable people, no 
better citizens, are found in our communities than those who bear 
Crane blood in them." 

Oct. 30, 1666, at a meeting in Branford, Conn., the prelimi- 
nary agreement outlining the conduct of the proposed new 
settlement upon the '• Passiack River in the Province of New 
Jersey " was signed by many Branford people, among them 
Jasper Crane senior and his sons John and Delivered.* These 
three names appear among the first proprietors of the town of 
Newark, and at the town meeting held Feb. 6, 1667, Mr. Jasper 
Crane, John and Deliverance * appear to have been present. 
Thenceforth for more than a century the name of Crane occupied 
a conspicuous place in the annals of the town, and scarcely a 
town meeting was held during a period of one hundred years that 
there was not a Crane chosen to fill some town office, and it was 
not unusual to elect to public positions several of the name at one 
meeting. But March 13, 1759, the family seemed to have reached 
the zenith of its popularity, for at that meeting by vote of the 
town eight different offices were filled by Cranes. As it appears, 
however, that John Crane was chosen collector and John Crane 
to serve on a committee to settle a line in the parsonage land, it 
may have required but seven Cranes to fill the eight posi- 
tions ; so that the election held this day exceeded but a trifle that 
held March 12, 1754, when six Cranes were elected to fill seven 
public positions. Their names were: John, for collector; 
Timothy and Ezekiel, surveyors of highways ; Elijah and William, 
overseers of the poor; John, clerk of strays; Noah, on com- 
mittee to settle the line between the towns of Newark and Eliza- 
beth towu. 

Jasper Crane's will, dated 1678. named children John, 
Azariah, Jasper, and Hannah Huntington, and granddaughter 
Hannah Huntington; John to have his "silver bole." Mr.

9. John Crane'- [2], (Jasper 1 ). Rev. Stephen Dodd says 
he married Elizabeth Foote, a sister of Nathaniel Foote, of 
Wethersfield. Conn., and settled in Brauford, Conn., in 1663, 
signing the Branford agreement with his father. He with his 
brothers Delivered and Jasper were among the first to remove to 
the settlement of Newark, N. J., in the spring of 1666. The first 
town meeting was held in Newark. May 21, 1666. He died in 
1694, aged 59. He was first elected to public office there as 
fence viewer. Jan. 2, 1670-1, and he soon became prominent 
in public affairs. He had a seat in the first meeting-house in 
Newark. Was among the deputies to the General Assembly of 
New Jersey, 1671-5. In 1674, he was chosen by vote of the 
town to warn the people, at his end of the town, of town 
meetings. He was chosen grand juryman for 1677, and select- 
man in 1683. His house lot plated on the map of Newark, 
published in 1806, places it on Broad Street, northerly from 
Trinity Episcopal Church and the upper Common, and ex- 
tending to the Passaic River. He was to have the '-silver 
bole," and at his death, the bowl evidently went to his brother 
Azariah, although it may have passed through the hands of 
Delivered. A warrant was issued under date. April 27, 1694, to 
him for seventy-three acres of land, in eight parcels, the fifth by 
Maple Island. His will, dated, 1694, proved Jan. 6, 1695,

Ireat, who was Governor of Connecticut during the Charter Oak 
affair Azariah appears to have outlived all the original settlers 
and left his silver bowl to be used forever in the"lst Presby- 
terian Church in Newark, where he was a deacon from 1690 until 
his death. He held many offices of public trust in the town : in 
1690, on committee of safety; in 1691, chosen to care for the 
poor of the town; in 1692, to treat with Rev. John Pruden to 
become the minister; Jan. 1693-4. deputy to Provincial Assemblv 
also deputy in 1695; selectman in 1676, 1683 and 1694; also as 
constable, grand juryman, pound-keeper; to look after the 
young people of the town, to lay out highwavs, view children's 
estates, overseer of the poor, etc. 

As early as 1715, he was living on his home place at the 
Mountain, and it is almost certain that he located there manv 
years prior to that date, for we find in the early town records 
the following : - By warrant, April 27, 1694, there was laid out 
by John Oardner a tract of land at the foot of the Mountain, 
having Azariah Crane on the northeast, and Jasper Crane on 
the southwest." 

June 9, 1679, warrants were issued to him for 136 acres in 
nine parcels, the sixth was fifty acres on branches of the Eliza- 
beth River, April 27, 1694, 100 acres in three parcels. April 
19, 1698, the town voted that a committee of five should view 
whether Azariah Crane should be given land out of the Com- 
mon for a tanyarcl at the front of John Plum's home lot ; on 
committee in 1706, to treat with Rev. Samuel Whittlesey, to 
settle in work of the ministry. They must have had some "little 
trouble in securing the right man, for March 21, 1708, he was 
on a committee to instruct Mr. Pearson, who was going to 
New England, to endeavor to procure a minister. He" secured

Nathaniel Bowers, who remained with the people there until his 
death, Aug 30, 1716, and again Mr. Crane was on committee to 
secure a new minister. 

There was apparently some hitch in the arrangement for the 
tannery before referred to, for Azariah soon after that date 
removed to a place near the mountain, and formed a settlement 
known as Cranetown (Montclair), six miles from Newark. 
Jan. 13, 1719, there was organized a Church called "The Society 
at the Mountain," now Orange, two miles west of Newark, and 
during that year land was purchased for a meeting-house plot of 
Thomas Gardner, and soon a small church edifice was erected. 
Azariah Crane became a prominent actor in the society, and for 
many years was a deacon there, living to the age of seventy- 
four years. 

His sons, Nathaniel, Noah, Azariah and William, also in their 
turn, took leading positions in this society, aiding materially with 
funds in building the church edifice. William succeeded his 
father Azariah as deacon in that Church. Oct., 1785, this 
mountain "Society at the Mountain" was first called "Orange 
Dale," and two "years later the "Dale" was omitted, and 
thenceforth known as Orange. 

In June, 1798, Joseph Crane, son of Noah, was deacon of 
this Church. He was then a resident of Cranetown, and after- 
wards became elder in the Church at Bloomfield. Of the elders 
in that Church by the name of Crane, we may name Lewis, who 
died in 1777, aged 59 ; Noah in office, 1776, died June 8, 1800, 
aged 81 ; Joseph, mentioned above, in office, 1794-98, died Oct. 
it, 1832, aged 81. Children:

She died Sept. 16, 1720, aged 69. He was born at East Haven, 
Conn., and removed with his parents to New Jersey. In 1684, 
he purchased the property of Robert Lyman, who had returned 
to England. He was a member of the Assembly in 1704, in 
Cornbury's time, and also a magistrate. 

He with his brothers John and Deliverance, owned seats in the 
first Church in Newark. Jasper, Jr., was given his share of 
public honors, having been chosen by popular vote to fill the 
various offices of fence viewer, surveyor of highways, constable, 
and selectman, as well as committeeman, deputy to the Provincial

Assembly in 1697-1702. and to see about settling the minister, 
and the boundary controversy between Newarkand Elizabeth- 
town, etc. He received two warrants for land, one, April 27, 
1694, and the other, April 10, 1696, aggregating 120 acres, 
located on branches of the Elizabethtown River. 

Jasper Crane has a house lot located on the map of Newark, 
published in 1806, at the corner of High and Market Streets ; 
whether this was meant for senior or junior does not appear. 

It is quite certain that he located in that part of Newark 
called Cranetown, afterwards West Bloomfield, now Montclair. 
Soon after the year 1681, at which time the town of Newark 
ordered the laying out of a highway as far as the mountain, 
which act no doubt was for the accommodation of settlers in 
that portion of the town, and where in the year, 1694, the town 
records give him a location, and it is said that his descendants, 
and those of his brother Azariah, occupied nearly, if not quite, 
all the westerly side of the town. He died March 6, 1712. aged 
62. His tombstone stood in the Presbyterian churchyard on 
Broad Street, Newark. According to his will he had the follow- 
ing children :

THIRD GENERATION. 307 

Bloomfield on the place which was afterwards occupied by Cyrus 
Pierson as late as 1851. The spring near which he lived is 
located near the railway depot in Montclair, N. J. He was 
chosen to record strays March, 1744. He died in 1760, aged 
about 80 years. The will (1760) names the children. 

About the year 1716 the people in and about Cranetown formed 
what for some years was known as the " Mountain Society " and 
later became the " Second Church of Newark," now the "First 
Presbyterian Church of Orange." He. in 1753, was one of the 
subscribers to build the second meeting-house. His son Nathan- 
iel, Jr., was also a subscriber with the following Cranes: Caleb, 
William. Job, Gamaliel, Noah, Stephen, Jedediah, Louis, Elihu 
and Ezekiel. Their subscriptions amounting to 56-16-6. Dec. 
7, 1796, a resolution was passed by the congregation and trustees 
assuming the title of "The Presbyterian Church of Bloomfield," 
and the following Cranes contributed to hire a minister for six 
months : Oliver, Stephen, William, Job, Simeon, Widow Susanna, 
Phineas, Noah, Noah, Jr., Joseph, Israel, Aaron, Nathaniel, 
Benjamin, Eleakim, Widow Jane and Iddok (probably meant for 
Zadock) . Children :

Jr., had wife Rebecca. In 1733 he granted three acres at the 
mountain plantation to his well beloved son-in-law Zachariah Bald- 
win. He settled at West Bloomfield, N. J., near his brother Na- 
thaniel. Elias B. Crane lived on the place in 1851. She died June 
15, 1739, aged 48, and he married again. He with his brother 
Nathaniel were the promoters of (Cranetown) Montclair, locating 
their home places near the spring which was a few years ago, and 
possibly at present time may be seen near the railroad depot at 
Montclair, N. J. In 1753 Azariah conveyed to his son Azariah 
a tract of land extending to the top of the mountain. He was a 
subscriber to the fund for erecting a parsonage at Montclair, and 
also the meeting-house. He was not without his honors at the 
hands of his fellow-townsmen; as early as Nov. 2, 1703, he was 
chosen one of the pounders. Children :

76. Robert Crane 3 [22], (Azariah, 2 Jasper 1 ), married 

Pbebe . She died May 13, 1759. He died July 14, 1755, 

aged 71. His will named children as given below. He is said to 
have lived in a stone house in Newark, N. J. It seems quite 
certain that having been named for his grandfather Robert Treat 
he inherited a part of the land in Newark once the property of 
this grandfather, located on Market Street, between Broad and 
Mulberry Streets, and back of the old meeting-house through to 
Washington Street. In 1806 the Presbyterian Church stood on 
what was once a portion of this estate. Mr. Isaac Watts Crane 
says Mulberry Street was formerly called Baldwin's Lane. He 
also writes that on this above-mentioned tract of land, meaning 
the Robert Treat estate, he could recall among those who had 
occupied it '-John Crane, Isaac, Timothy, Obadiah, & Azariah." 
They were doubtless all of them descendants of Deacon Azariah 
Crane, father of this Robert. March 11, 1718, he was chosen 
pounder, and surveyor of highways in 1736 and 1737, and fence 
viewer in 17-10. Children :

154. William Crane 4 [61], (Nathaniel, 3 Azariah,' 2 Jasper 1 ), 

married 1st, Wheeler, of Newark ; 2d, Mary (or Mercy) . 

He resided in that part of Newark called for many years Crane- 
town, then West Bloomfleld, now Mont Clair, N. J., and was a 
subscriber for the purpose of hiring a minister to preach the Gos- 
pel there. He was overseer of the poor from 1753 to 1756 inclu- 
sive, and of highways from 1760 to 1764; freeholder, 1767. He 
may have inherited property here from his father, and possibly 
succeeded to the home estate ; of that, however, we are not cer- 
tain, but the notable Crane mansion occupied by him or his family 
during the period of the war of the Revolution, still standing at 
the junction of Valley road and Clairmont avenue, was his home, 
and occupied about three weeks by Gen. Washington as his head- 
quarters, Gen. Lafayette being with him. The time of occupa- 
tion doubtless being from the latter week in October to about the 
middle of November, 1780. While those two great generals 
were making Mr. Crane's house their home, he with four if not 
five of his sons were performing soldiers' duties in the army of 
which they were the commanders. It is related by Rev. Oliver

CRAXE GENEALOGY. 



Crane, D.D.. LL.D.. that on the arrival of Gen. Washington at 
the house, Mercy Crane then in charge, and causing supper to be 
prepared, discovered she had no tea to serve, and becoming 
quite disturbed about it offered an apology to the General for 
the lack of what might seem to him an important feature of his 
repast. '• Never mind, my good lady," replied His Excellency. 
•• please have a crust of bread toasted and use it for tea. that is 
good enough for me." ilrs. Crane's anxiety was thus dispelled, 
and supper was served. Night came on. and the capacity of the 
house for beds was overtaxed, the lower back room selected by 
the two generals for their use, had been used for the dining-room, 
the deficiency of beds then was thereupon made known to the 
General, who rejoined. '■ But there is plenty of straw in the barn, 
is there not? " The straw was soon brought in and spread in one 
corner of the room, and the two famous generals retired to rest, 
wrapped in their army blankets, on that bundle of straw.

Zadoc. b. 1758; m.; no children; d. 1841. Gen. Washing- 
ton had an old gray horse which was almost as well known 
as its rider. Zadoc Crane, one of the Revolutionary 
Fathers, took care of the old gray when Washington was 
at Cranetown. in New Jersey. While Zadoc took care of 
the horse, the family entertained Washington, and waited 
upon him with a finely Japanned server. This server, 
though the Japanning is all worn off, was brought to the 
Fair to exhibit in Bric-a-brac, by Mrs. Emma Fasshaber, 
whose father was Zadoc Crane's uncle. Those were times 
famous for having tried men's souls, and it was absolutely 
necessary to exercise the greatest care and vigilance. The 
oats fed to Washington's horse were kept concealed under 
a stack of hay. and every time Zadoc got a mess from 
under it he replaced the hay nicely, and after feeding, he 
carefully picked up every scattered straw for fear the 
British might nose the oats and •' cahoage" them. 

During the time Washington was occupying "Cranetown 
Gap," as he styled it, the alarm came that the British were 
about to make an attempt on the American lines in their 
somewhat insecure position, and desiring to be in readi- 
ness to meet such a movement should it he made, and not 
feeling at this critical moment that he had a man to spare 
from the ranks, he called for volunteers outside of those 
in the service to act as couriers to warn the minute-men 
living beyond the so called " first and second mountains," 
covering the region between the Passaic River and the 
second mountain, including Horseneck, Pine Brook, Swine- 
field, etc. Zadoc. a son of William, who had been lame 
from boyhood, offered to assume the ditficult and perilous 
undertaking. Although lame, one leg being shorter than

the other, was well able to ride on horseback, and soon 
appeared mounted on his own spirited horse, and armed 
with a heavy cutlass, this being his only weapon; just as 
the sun was disappearing behind the mountains, under 
special orders from the General, he set out on his impor- 
tant errand. It was a ride for the night, calling at every 
house and routing them from their slumbers. As the 
gray of the morning began to show itself, he was march- 
ing his men toward the Crane mansion, and just at day- 
break drew up his squad in front of the doorstep, on 
which stood Gen. Washington for the purpose of inspect- 
ing them. " Well done, my man," was the salute of His 
Excellency. " Now come in and take a horn of whiskey, 
for you must need it."

March 3, 1755, he was chosen one of the assessors for the town

lutionary war he lived in Newark, was taken prisoner by the 
British, and had his feet frozen from exposure. He lived in a 
stone house, with quite a large lot of land surrounding it, situated 

on Street, in Newark, N. J. His youngest daughter Abigail 

inherited the estate, and resided there for many years, refusing 
to part with the land, although urged to do so by persons needing 
it for the site of stores and for other business purposes. In 1836 
she was residing there ; but a few years later she was persuaded 
to relinquish the place and secure a home in another portion of 
the city. It is said she had previously refused $10,000 in money 
and a lot with a much better house upon it in exchange for her 
home. But now she was far advanced in years and by force of 
circumstances obliged to yield to the onward march of improve- 
ments. She died about 1844, soon after leaving her old home. 
This stone house had over the door the figures 1760. Mr. 
Edwin Crane thinks that may have been the date of its con- 
struction. Children :

318. Josiah Crane 4 [101], (Joseph, 3 Jasper, 2 Jasper 1 ), 

married Phebe . Will, 1786, names children and wife 

Phebe. From the headstone at his grave we learn that he died 
Dec. 15. 1785, in the 67th year of his age, and that he was 
known as Captain Josiah Crane ; also that his wife's name 
was Jerusha; that she died Oct. 10, 1777, in the 55th year of her 
age. The writer has not been able to learn whether Captain 
Josiah lived at Connecticut Farms or not, although his son 
Josiah did ; therefore it is uncertain which one of these two 
Josiahs is referred to in the town records, March 8, 1768, where 
it reads: "Josiah Crane, at the Farms, chosen one of the over- 
seers of highways." At this time there were no less than four 
Josiah Cranes, of suitable age to serve in public office ; hence 
the difficulty of proper designation. Children :

Burnet writes that most of the Cranes in the line of Joseph, 
lived during the last century, between Newark and South 
Orange, N. J., in and about Springfield, and at North Farms, 
now Middleville. March 8, 1757, was chosen one of the over- 
seers of highways. She was left a widow, and married Paul 
Day, and her will, dated 1785, names the following children: 

328—1. Abigail, b. April 1, 1750.

FIFTH GENERATION. 



400. Stephen Crane 5 [132], (Edmund. 4 John, 3 John, 3 Jas- 
per 1 ). Quite recently we have been furnished data which, to the 
best of our judgment, after careful investigation, belongs here. 
And being unable to perfect the line before the arrangement of 
other families was made, the full line is entered at this point. 
The above Stephen Crane was a cooper by trade, and lived in 
Elizabeth, N. J. Subsequently he removed to Goshen, N. Y. 
Married , and the following, with record of his descend- 
ants, has been furnished by Rev. Floyd N. Crane, of Goshen, 
son of John Sears Crane : 

In a bond of indemnity by Nathaniel Ball, of Newark, N. J., 
to Stephen Crane, dated April '22, 1761, Josiah Crane was a 
witness. 

In a deed of 59 acres to Stephen Crane by Elkanah Fuller, 
Stephen C. is said to be '• of late from East New Jersey." 

In an old bond of my grandfather, John Crane, to his brother, 
Stephen. Jr., the time of payment is thus worded: "the same to 
be paid sis months after the death of Stephen Crane, the father 
of the said Stephen Crane, Jun r ." 

In a deed made "May 20, 1757, in the 30 th yr of his Majes- 
ties Reign King George the Second of Great Brittain, Between 
Josiah Woodruff of Borough of Elizabeth in the County of Essex 
& Eastern Division of the Province of N. J. & Stephen Crane 
of the Borough aforesaid." Consideration, "110 pounds at 8 
shillings the ounce & all one certain Messuage & in the Borough 
of Elizabeth, 3 1 acres with House, &c."

daughter of Dr. Benjamin Hathaway, of Morristown, N. J., 
bom Oct. 6, 1746; she died April 19, 1792. 

Mrs. D. H. Law, a descendant who has given much time to 
investigation, writes that he entered into covenant in the Pres- 
byterian Church of Morristown, Nov. 4, 1764; that he served as 
lieutenant in Captain Halsey's Company, Eastern Battalion. 
Morris Co., N. .1. Militia, during August and September. 1776, 
and as captain from September until the close of the Revolu- 
tionary war. In the spring of 1784. he removed to Goshen, 
N. Y., with his three sons, and purchased three hundred acres 
of land in Orange Co.. giving each of them a farm there. 
Some of his descendants still (1897) reside on a portion of 
that original tract of land. By trade he was a hatter, and 
before removing to New York State, kept a store in Morristown, 
N. J. He was a large man, weighing about 250 pounds. Is 
said to have married three times, one wife being a Kitchell, of 
Rockaway Neck, N.-J-, but all his children were by his first 
wife. He died July 14. 1822, aged 77. He was a man of good 
repute, and enjoyed the confidence and respect of all who knew 
him. His last wife survived him. Children :

437. As the brothers whose names are given below were cousins 
of the above Shadrack Crane, we give here what we have been 
able to obtain concerning their descendants. The name of their 
father seems not to have been made clear. Whether it was 
Stephen or John (uncles to Shadrack) we do not know, although 
that would seem probable, or it may have been Aaron. Alexan- 
der Dallas Crane gave the latter as his grandfather's name, and at 
the same time said his own father Stephen was cousin to Shadraeh 
Crane, who married Hannah Palmer. A daughter of Martin L. 
Crane writes : " Aaron was half brother to Stephen. I think. I 
never heard his name mentioned in connection with the Cranes 
but once or twice, and then I asked my father who Aaron was ; 
he said to me he was ' an odd sheep ' and they never paid any 
attention to him. That is all I know of the said Aaron."

arriving there Nov. 24. stopping at Ann Arbor. Three years 
later he located at Dexter, continuing to work at his trade until 
1832, when he began the study of law. Was soon elected 
constable ; and subsequently was deputy sheriff and collector 
of taxes, continuing in the latter position ten years. He tried 
merchandising for a year and a half, when, in 1343. he was 
admitted to the bar. and learned to practice in the legal pro- 
fession. In 1 84 9 President Fillmore appointed him post- 
master at Dexter: also served as justice of the peace. At 
the close of the year 1853 he resigned the postmastership to 
accept the office of prosecuting attorney of Washtenaw Co., 
1854 to 1»65. Four times in succession he was called upon 
to preside over the circuit court as its judge, and in 1873 he 
was appointed judge of the fourth judicial district of Michi- 
gan, embracing the counties of Jackson, Ingham and Washte- 
naw, which seat he tilled with credit and honor for three 
years. At the close of his judgeship he formed a copartner- 
ship with A. .1. Sawyer at Ann Arbor. Little later he returned 
to Dexter, where he continued his law practice, adding the 
insurance business, and continuing it until failing health com- 
pelled the relinquishment of all care. Mr. Crane was ap- 
pointed colonel of the 7th Regt., 4th Brigade, 2d division of 
Michigan State Militia, bv Governor S. T. Mason. March 30.

Central New York, and settled in the town of Genoa, Cayuga 
County. He stayed there until the 6th of May, 1810, when he 
moved to what is now the town of Marion, Wayne County, about 
one-half mile from the pleasant little village of Marion. His 
house was made of logs, with bark roof, stone fireplace, and 
blankets for doors. In this house he lived about two years, 
clearing his land and turning his hand to anything by which he 
might earn an honest penny. He built the first blacksmith shop 
in town. He was also a famous shingle-maker; could do a fair 
job at mason- work or carpentering. In the War of 1812 he went 
to the defence of Pultneyville, and afterwards volunteered for sis 
months on Niagara frontier, serving most of the time on detached 
duty, building barracks and other mechanical work ; was taken

of the war. his wife having died, he returned to New York, 

purchased a home there, and married Abby , by whom it is 

said he had five children, names of four of whom we have not 
been able to obtain in connection with the record of this Ezekiel, 
although some of them may be found in the book. Reports seem 
to indicate that he was twice married, but have nothing to prove 
the statement. Dec 12, 1303, he was shot by John, a Delaware 
Indian, who was arraigned in Court, pleaded guilty and was 
hanged, Aug. 17, 1804. As this was the first murder trial held 
in Cayuga Co., it may be interesting to give account of it, taken 
from records of the Court. The murder was committed in Junius, 
then in that County, but now in Seneca County. The trial was 
held in June, 1«04, at Aurora, then the County seat. Judge 
Ambrose Spencer, of the Supreme Court, presided, assisted by 
Seth Phelps. John Tillotson. Joseph Annin. and Joseph Beardsly, 
•■Justices of Oyer and Terminer." William Stuart was district 
attorney, and Samuel Buel, sheriff. The indictment is as follows : 

Cayu:ra County, ss.

December, in the year of our Lord 1803 aforesaid, at the town afore- 
said, in the town aforesaid, in the county aforesaid, he the said Ezekiel 
Crane, of the mortal wound aforesaid died ; And so the jurors afore- 
said, upon their oath aforesaid, do sav that the said John, a Delaware

hazel eves. In the year 1824. he removed with his family to 
Ohio, making the journey by wagon. The distance to Worth- 
ington, Franklin County, from the old home, was about six 
hundred and forty miles, and twenty-six days were consumed in

there were other families in the party, but as Mr. Crane declined 
to travel on the Sabbath day. they became separated ; at the end 
of the journev. however, Mr. Crane arrived two days in advance 
of the other wing of the party. Ohio was then a sparsely 
settled country, and, although they found their friends who had 
previously removed from Orange County, N. Y., to Franklin 
County, Ohio, it took some little time for the newcomers to 
adapt themselves to the new surroundings. The next year 
(1325) they went on to Sunbury, Delaware Co., where they re- 
mained through the summer ; then a brief stay was made at 
Monroe, but after another trial at Blendon, Franklin County, 
the final settlement was made in Licking County. For some 
years Mr. Crane busied himself in teaching school winters and 
farming summers. In his latter years he made his home with 
his son Abram K.. until his wife Dorothy died, then he went to 
live with his eldest son Joseph B.. in Illinois. In politics

SIXTH GENERATION. 381 

Through the kindness of Mr. John G. Crane, of Baltimore, Md., the 
writer was permitted to read a memoir of this good man, James C. 
Crane. It was written by J. L. Burrows, D.D., pastor of the First 
Baptist Church, of Richmond, Va., and published at Charleston, S. C, 
by the Southern Baptist Publication Society, in 1858. Dr. Burrows 
here pays Mr. Crane the highest compliments for his manly and 
Christian qualities, and presents him as an ideal for other men to 
follow. Surely no person could read that little book without enter- 
taining the thought that the Crane family have at least furnished one 
life to be a worthy example for imitation. 

It appears that his brother William located in Richmond, Va., in 
1812, and started in the leather trade; that in 1819, James, at the age of 
sixteen, went there as a clerk in this store. After a few years he was 
admitted a partner, and soon another store was opened in Baltimore, 
Md., William attending to that, while James conducted the one at 
Richmond. In 18-12 the partnership was dissolved, William taking the 
business at Baltimore, and James that at Richmond. As early as 
March, 1817, Mr. Crane was baptized into the Baptist Church, and ever 
until his death, walked in the true faith of his Lord and Master, 
giving freely of his time, talent and means for the furtherance of 
religion.

in writing about her mother, recites an incident that occurred 
during the civil war that speaks so much for the character of 
the woman that it certainly deserves a place here : " A draft 
of soldiers had been called for in our county. I happened 
to be the oue to admit the officer to the house. He told me 
his business, and I called my mother from another room to 
meet him. He told her in an offhand and somewhat offensive 
way that he was taking names of all male members of each 
family in that part of the county preparatory to drafting; 
took out his pen, and opened his great book. 1 looked at 
my mother, who was an exceedingly handsome woman, with 
faultless physique, wondering what her reply might be. She 
stood a moment; then, with impressive dignity, said : ' Sir,

I have three sons only, — one of them is in a southern prison, 
another was in the battle of Fort Fisher, and we await the 
tidings of his death. The last one lies at the point of death 
in this house from a wound received in a late battle. I have 
three daughters ; if they can be of any service to their 
country, take them.' The great book closed with a slam, 
and the officer bowed in deepest respect and said, ' Madam, 
yon have done your duty.' " Children :

stead settled by his grandfather Capt. Josiah Crane, in the town of 
Wallkill, near Middletown, Orange Co., N. Y. His early life was 
spent with his father working on the farm. About the age of 16 
he met with a serious accident caused by the running away of a 
team of horses, depriving him of his left arm near the shoulder, 
and almost of his life. After much suffering he finally recov- 
ered ; and, being possessed of a strong intellect and a studious 
disposition, he prepared himself for the work of teaching, a voca- 
tion he followed for many years. He was elected justice of the 
peace, and also collector of taxes ; both of which offices he held 
by reelection for many years. 

In the spring of 1842 he removed to Burlingham, Sullivan 
Co., N. Y., where he remained until 1860, and then returned to 
his native town, where he spent his remaining years. 

Squire Crane, as he was universally known, was a great reader, 
a deep thinker, and a ready debater, — a man of decided literary 
tastes and culture. He was greatly respected for his many 
Christian virtues and rectitude of character. 

Two or three weeks before his death he attended a revival 
meeting in a Methodist Church near his home. Although bent 
with the weight of years, and suffering from bodily infirmities, he 
walked to the church in the evening, and delivered a powerful 
and affecting exhortation to the unconverted. Those who heard

him said that he spoke like one inspired and conscious of his 
approaching end. 

A few days later he was stricken with apoplexy, and died April 
13, 1869. He was buried at the Circleville Presbyterian Church, 
of which he was one of the founders and an elder for forty 
years. The whole community loved and respected him during his 
life and mourned his death. Children :

STEPHEN' CRANE, OF ELIZABETHTOWN, NEW 
JERSEY, AND HIS DESCENDANTS. 



FIRST GENERATION. 



1. Stephen Crane, 1 born about 1630 or 1635. Some have 
claimed he was born as early as 1619, but that date seems too early 
from a careful consideration of the whole subject. Tradition says 
became from England or Wales between the years 1640 and 1660. 
He was one of the original settlers of Elizabethtown, and one 
of the company of colonists who planted the first English set- 
tlement in what is now the State of New Jersey. He was called 
one of the "Elizabethtown Associates," and was there as early 
as 1665, for he took the oath of allegiance to Lord King Charles 
II. and his successors February 19th of that year. The deed by 
which the first settlers claimed their land was dated Oct. "28, 
1664, so that the fall of 1664 or spring of 1665 would be quite 
as early as it is safe to fix the date of the settlement. In 1675 
he obtained from the proprietors of East Jersey a patent to con- 
firm his title to lands in Elizabethtown ; dates given below. In 
1710 he executed a deed to his son Nathaniel, giving him his 
house lot, with other pieces of land in Elizabethtown ; and, in 
describing the bounds of these lands, they were said to be 
bounded on lands of John Crane, Daniel Crane, Jeremiah and 
Azariah Crane. The fact that he settled within such close 
proximity to the family of Jasper Crane might indicate that there 
was a family connection existing between them ; but up to the' 
present time no proof of any blood relationship has come to 
light. Samuel H. Cougar, Esq., late librarian of the New Jersey 
Historical Society, who gave careful consideration to the subject, 
wrote that " this Stephen was probably nearly related to Jasper 
Crane, of Newark," and that he came to New Jersey from Con- 
necticut. Rev. Jonathan T. Crane was also of the opinion that 
he was a relative of Jasper. Isaac Watts Crane, Esq., in Decem- 
ber, 1848, stated that it was his opinion that this Stephen was 
either a son or a brother of Jasper Crane, of Newark, — that the 
Elizabethtown Cranes claim descent from Jasper. We first meet 
with h.'m at Elizabethtown where he lived ; prior to the year 1664 
we hav^ no knowledge of his origin beyond tradition. He was 
active iL resisting the claims of the proprietors in the great land

dispute, which was never settled. His name appears as defendant 
in the Elizabethtown bill in chancery, schedule No. 8, page 104. 
The answer to this bill was printed in 1752. This land was sur- 
veyed to him in the year 1676, — one Warren for 120 acres in 
Elizabethtown. dated March 28th ; another of 156 acres, October 
2d; still another of 156 acres, November 30th. One of these 
156-acre lots was bounded by Crane's Brook, east by the Mill 
Creek, and east by the highway. His six-acre house lot was a 
part of this tract. By his will, dated 1709, he bequeathed to his 
son John a certain piece of land within the bounds of Elizabeth- 
town, and died a few years later. 

Rev. Elias N. Crane contributes the following, found among 
the papers of his father, Rev. Elias W. Crane, son of Noah, and 
the account purports to come from Mr. Isaac Crane, of Eliza- 
bethtown, son of Caleb, Jr., great-great-grandson of Stephen 
senior : " About 1625 A. D., thirty years before Elizabeth Town, 
N. J., was setttled, during the persecutions of the Puritans in 
England under Queen Elizabeth, the ancestor of the Crane 
family came to America. His name was Stephen. The ship in 
which he came is supposed to have sailed from the west of 
England, favored at embarkation by a fog, which allowed escape 
in case of pursuit. When the fog passed away the ship was out 
of sight of land. It is said to have sunk at Amboy, N. J., but 
all on board were saved. Stephen Crane and his fellow voyagers 
settled Elizabeth Town, named for Queen Elizabeth, who con- 
firmed the purchase of lands from the Indians." This Isaac 
Crane was born July 20, 1766, about one hundred years after the 
settlement of Elizabeth Town, and it would seem that at that 
time there might have been some connecting link to bind the his- 
tory of the early settlement to the period in which this Isaac 
Crane lived. We often find one life to span that interim; cer- 
tainly two would have done it from father to son ; it could have 
been handed down to Isaac or some other member of the family. 
But let us analyze this bit of history. If this Stephen Crane 
came to America, as indicated, iu 1625, for the purpose of assist- 
ing in establishing a settlement, he must have been twenty or 
twenty-five years of age, and we know he lived until 1710; 
therefore he would be one hundred and five years old at his death, 
a very improbable event; again, in the natural course of things, 
his children would have been born twenty or thirty years earlier 
than they were born. People exposed to the hardships of those 
days seldom reached the age of seventy- five and children were 
born to them usually before the parents were seventy or even 
sixty-five years old. Again, if Stephen had been in this country 
thirty years before the settlement of Elizabeth Town, we should 
find some record of it somewhere. From all that can be proven, 
this Stephen Crane was born about 1630 or 1635 in England, 
and probably was son of Jasper, perhaps by a former mirriage. 
It is said that his wife was a Danish woman, with red '.air, and

went to sea, about the year 1800. While sailing as mate of an 
East Indian merchant vessel, the captain died, leaving the mate, 
then but eighteen years of age, in command of the ship. The 
trip proved successful, and the owners were so well pleased with

tion of friends, gave up the seafaring life, and removed to Har- 
ford, where his brother David had been living, but then deceased.

Caulk's Field, in 1814. He settled first in Kent Co., Md., later 
went to New Orleans. La. He married Eleanor Fullerton Crane, 
widow of his brother Roger. 

Mrs. Alfred Stille furnishes the following, which was related to 
her by her father David Crane Blackiston : " The battle of 
Caulk's Field was fought near Tolchester, about ten miles below 
Chester Town, Kent" Co., Md., Aug. 30, 1812. There was 
great consternation among the people of Chester Town, because 
Sir Peter Parker, commander of the British forces, made oath on 
landing that he • would burn Chester Town, or eat breakfast in 
hell.' 

"The American forces were under command of Col. Philip 
Reed, and several of David Crane's sons were in the engage- 
ment, having volunteered as soon as danger appeared. Philip, 
who was named for his kinsman. Col. Philip Reed, was among 
the number. The British lost fifteen men and Sir Peter Parker 
was mortally wounded by a stray buckshot, and died before 
reaching his boat Thus Chester Town and other places along 
the shore were spared the proposed destruction. Philip Crane 
received a wound in the hip early in the engagement, but drop- 
ping on his knees continued to load and fire until the battle was 
over, and, as the shot which struck Sir Peter Parker came from 
the direction of Philip Crane, it was supposed he fired the fatal 
shot. After the close of the battle, Peter Crane was carried 
from the field, and his wound cared for, although he was lame 
throughout his life."

" Died — November 15, 1858, at the residence of Dr. Abraham 
Street. Harford County, Md., John Crane, Esq., of Preston 
County, Va., aged 59 years, 2 months and 19 days. Mr. Crane 
was a prominent citizen of Preston, his native county, and 
will be much lamented and greatly missed by an extensive circle 
of friends. He was eminently a business man. Twenty-three 
years since he emigrated to the beautiful portion of the county 
known as ' The Pine Swamp.' Under the hand of industrial 
enterprise the wilderness was rapidly changed to fruitful fields. 
At the time of his death Mr. Crane had in his plantation one 
thousand acres of improved land in the midst of a prosperous 
and growing settlement. A thriving little town had arisen upon 
his premises, which, in honor of its founder, is called Crane- 
ville. For many years he has been the medium of exchange 
between the eastern markets and the principal stock dealers of 
the county. But he lived not for this world alone. Twentv- 
seven years since, with his companion, he embraced the gospel,

been discovered that it was impossible fc> place with absolute

ADDENDA. 561 

No doubt the following are descendants from New Jersey 
Cranes, and perhaps from Jasper : 

The wife of Chilion Crane (59) writes that Jesse Crane, born 
at Hanover, N. J., was father of Asa and Jesse Crane, brothers, 
who settled in Bridport, Vt. But Mahlon Crane (58) wrote 
that he thought his grandfather's name was Abijah, that he died, 
leaving four young boys, names as given below. David proba- 
bly served in the Revolutionary war, from Moms Co., N. Y., 
and Daniel from Essex. 

1. Daniel; served in the Revolutionary war, and was killed. 2 
David; left New Jersey at the clos"e of the Revolutionary war, 
aud not heard from. 

53—3. Asa, b. July 16, 1758; his granddaughter says Asa's father was 
Jesse Crane. 

54 — 1. Jesse, b. Aug. 29, 1760. 

55. Asa Ckane [53], born in New Jersey on the banks 
of the Passaic River; lived there until after his marriage. 
His son Mahlon writes that his father was with Washing- 
ton's army four years ; was at Valley Forge with the army ; 
was near by when Major Andre was taken and hanged ; 
was at the battle of Monmouth, N T . J. ; also at the battle 
of Princeton, wbere he was wounded in the leg. Was a Revolu- 
tionary pensioner. Married Abigail Young, Dec. 28, 1784. She 
was born Sept. 26, 1765, and died Jan. 5, 1839. He died Sept. 
23, 184:8, at Bridport, Vt. She died there also. As near as it 
can be ascertained he was born at or near Hanover Neck, N. 
J., and married, and lived there until his three eldest children 
were born. The family then removed to Goshen, Orange Co., 
N. Y., where they remained a few years, when they removed to 
Lumberland, Ulster Co. Here they lived about ten years, when 
in the year 1808 they removed to Bridport, Vt. , where his 
brother was then living. In the official register of officers and 
men of New Jersey in the Revolutionary war we find the name 
of Asa Crane, Morris County, also Somerset 1st battalion, 
also State troops, and also Continental army, which quite likely 
refers to this Asa Crane; and as serving in Capt. Piatt's com- 
pany, 1st battalion, second establishment; also in militia. 
The following information was obtained by Mrs. Johnson, a 
granddaughter of Asa Crane: ''He enlisted in May, 1778, in 
the Revolutionary war, and served as private for nine months in 
Capt. Daniel Piatt's company, Col. Ogden's regiment, Gen. Max- 
well's brigade. New Jersey line. He was stationed at this time at 
Valley Forge and Mt. Holly. He was engaged in the battle 
of Monmouth, and was honorably discharged at Elizabethtown, 
N. J. He also served several times in other tours of military 
service, but records did not say where. He applied for a pension 
from Addison County, Vt., April 1, 1818. The pension was 
allowed, and he received it regularly until his death, which

John Grinnell [2], married three times. His first wife 
was Miss Tinkham, sister to Alanson and R. M. Tinkham, his 
brothers-in-law. She died, leaving six children. Two years 
later he married again. By this marriage he had two children. 
She died, and in IK47 he married his third wife, who was living 
in January, 1882, having had one child, a daughter, born about 

1850. In the fall of 1820, Mr. Grinnell left his home in , 

and took up wild land in Barre, Genesee Co. (since 1824 
Orleans County), for the purpose of making a home, and will 
give the story as he penned it: "I told you the trade with the 
Tinkham boys ; they married my sisters, and I married theirs. I 
located my land in the fall of 1820, and built a placebo come to 
in the winter. There was not'mueh snow that winter, and one of the 
Tinkham boys and I had a pair of three-year-old steers between us. 
We bought a pair of old wagon wheels, made a cart, yoked the 
steers, took our axes, cooking utensils, bed clothes, two cows, 
and started for our new home. From second day of April until fore 
part of June we kept our own house, boarding ourselves ; our cows 
both gave milk, and we got some baking done about a mile away 
at our nearest neighbor. We took turns cooking. Sunday morn- 
ing we had shortcake and butter. One would do the chores, 
milking, &c, while the other would attend to the cooking, make 
the butter, &c. About the middle of June our wives' fathers 
came out with wagons, bringing their goods. Our nearest neigh- 
bors were west one mile, north two and a half miles, east three 
miles, south ten miles, the Indian Reservation lying between us, 
and settlers south. I now (1882) have a home farm of 197 acres, 
with three houses and four barns, and a 62 1 acre timber lot. We 
are half way between Rochester and Buffalo. We raised last 
season one thousand bushels of wheat and forty acres of barley 
now on the ground. I have seven boys, — two that work my 
farm ; one living three miles south of here ; one in St. Clair 
County, Mich. ; another in Coldwater, that State ; one in Chicago 
at the stock yards ; and one in Iowa. 

" I cannot tell you the name of the town in New Jersey Uncle 
Stephen found his father Moses Crane ; but he afterwards came 
to New York State to see his children in Spafford, Onondaga Co., 
and my father and mother and Uncle Stephen came with him to my 
house to see us ; that was the only lime I saw Grandfather Moses

nership thirty-five years. They removed from Saratoga County 
to Oneida Co., town of Augusta, and from there to Pompey, 
Onondaga County, and from there just over the line into Fabius, 
then to Spafford, where they died. I left Barre in 1854, having 
purchased a farm in Shelby, an adjoining town, and three miles 
distant, where I now reside."

made a trip to Louisiana on a visit, and was so much pleased 
with the country that in 1821 he, with his family, removed to that 
State, locating at Rapides Parish, where he established a cotton 
plantation ; Texas then was a part of Mexico. The route 
travelled in making the journey to Louisiana was via Pittsburgh, 
Pa., down the river to Louisville, Ky., thence down the Missis- 
sippi River to Xatchez, where they visited Col. Wood, a relative 
of Mrs. Crain, who went there from Maryland, and was then a 
wealthy planter, and from Xatchez on to Rapides Parish. Mrs. 
Crain was cousin to Mrs. Margaret (nee Smith), wife of Gen. 
Zachary Taylor, one of whose daughters was first wife of Jeffer- 
son Davis. She died Sept. 27, 1850. He died Aug. 27, 1852,

•217. Jane Adaline Crane [1], married December 12, 
1834, at the home of her father, Oak Hill, La., Dr. Levon 
Luckett, of Fauquier Count} 7 , Va. She was born at the Wood 
family mansion in Prince George's County, Md., and in 
1822 removed with her parents to Rapides Parish, La. After her 
marriage they settled in Alexandria. To this good woman we 
are deeply indebted for nearly every particle of information 
respecting this line of Maryland and Virginia families, and from 
her letters written to Mr. Herbert Henry Crain, of Key West. 
Fla., these records have been chiefly taken. She writes: "The 
Virginia Crains and my father's family are undoubtedly the 
direct descendants of one of the brothers who came from Wales 
and settled in that State (Virginia), and scattered out as his pos- 
terity increased, into the adjoining State of Maryland and the 
far off State of Louisiana. The number of my grandchildren 
is 42 or 43, and of my great-grandchildren enough to settle 
a small colony." She writes further: "Tradition says the 
three brothers who came over from Wales were wealthy and of 
high standing. One settled in Virginia (my grandfather's an- 
cestor) ; one in Maryland ; a descendant of the latter married my 
grandfather Wood's sister, and Judge Peter Crain, of Annapolis. 
Md., was a son." (See page 583.) 

There were others of the name. One was Dr. Robert Crain. 
They were contemporaries with my grandfather's family, and 
distantly related. Their names I do not remember. They set- 
tled in Priuce George's and Charles Counties, Md., and my uncle 
Bailey Crain married one of the daughters. One of the brothers 
went to New Jersey. Children : 

1. Robert Levon (Luckett), b. Dee. 12, 1837. 2. Letitia Eliza- 
beth (Luckett) , b. Dec. 19, 1839. 3. Frances Berkeley (Luck-

April 24, 1895, at 1 o'clock p. m. He had been seriously ill for

dria, in 1861. Fourteen children were born; ten now survive.

Parishes in 1880, serving four years; appointed United States 
marshal for the western district of Louisiana by President Cleve- 
land in 1893, holding the office at the time of his death. He was 
an ardent anti-lottery advocate, and did much to check the evil. 
It was Bob Luckett that was made chairman of the committee 
that visited the McEnery-Wickliffe convention at Baton Rouge. 
His conduct then showed him to be a man of courage and strong 
convictions. He willingly served the poor without remuneration 
as their physician. His death was a severe blow to his native 
Parish and to the State.
